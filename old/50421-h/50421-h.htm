<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the
noble deeds with which the Military History of our
country abounds. To hold forth these bright
examples to the imitation of the youthful soldier,
and thus to incite him to emulate the meritorious
conduct of those who have preceded him in their
honourable career, are among the motives that have
given rise to the present publication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the "London Gazette," from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
approbation, constitute the reward which the
soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall in future keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so
long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service, and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable
life, by which so many national benefits are obtained
and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services, and of acts of individual
bravery, can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under His Majesty's special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General's
Office; and while the perusal of them can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>not
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i> &mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
"firm as the rocks of their native shore;" and when
half the World has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,
our fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
deeds before us, will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The ancient Armies of England were composed
of Horse and Foot; but the feudal troops established
by William the Conqueror in 1086, consisted
almost entirely of Horse. Under the feudal
system, every holder of land amounting to what
was termed a "knight's fee," was required to
provide a charger, a coat of mail, a helmet, a
shield, and a lance, and to serve the Crown a
period of forty days in each year at his own
expense; and the great landholders had to provide
armed men in proportion to the extent of
their estates; consequently the ranks of the feudal
Cavalry were completed with men of property,
and the vassals and tenants of the great barons,
who led their dependents to the field in person.</p>

<p>In the succeeding reigns the Cavalry of the
Army was composed of Knights (or men at arms)
and Hobiliers (or horsemen of inferior degree);
and the Infantry of spears and battle-axe men,
cross-bowmen, and archers. The Knights wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
armour on every part of the body, and their
weapons were a lance, a sword, and a small
dagger. The Hobiliers were accoutred and armed
for the light and less important services of war,
and were not considered qualified for a charge in
line. Mounted Archers<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were also introduced,
and the English nation eventually became preeminent
in the use of the bow.</p>

<p>About the time of Queen Mary the appellation
of "<em>Men at Arms</em>" was changed to that of "<em>Spears</em>
and <em>Launces</em>." The introduction of fire-arms ultimately
occasioned the lance to fall into disuse,
and the title of the Horsemen of the first degree
was changed to "<em>Cuirassiers</em>." The Cuirassiers
were armed <em>cap-à-pié</em>, and their weapons were a
sword with a straight narrow blade and sharp
point, and a pair of large pistols, called petronels;
and the Hobiliers carried carbines. The Infantry
carried pikes, matchlocks, and swords. The
introduction of fire-arms occasioned the formation
of Regiments armed and equipped as infantry,
but mounted on small horses for the sake of
expedition of movement, and these were styled
"<em>Dragoons</em>;" a small portion of the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
force of the kingdom, however, consisted of this
description of troops.</p>

<p>The formation of the present Army commenced
after the Restoration in 1660, with the establishment
of regular corps of Horse and Foot; the
Horsemen were cuirassiers, but only wore armour
on the head and body; and the Foot were pikemen
and musketeers. The arms which each
description of force carried, are described in the
following extract from the "Regulations of King
Charles II.," dated 5th May, 1663:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Each Horseman to have for his defensive
armes, back, breast, and pot; and for his offensive
armes, a sword, and a case of pistolls, the
barrels whereof are not to be und<sup>r</sup>. foorteen
inches in length; and each Trooper of Our
Guards to have a carbine besides the aforesaid
armes. And the Foote to have each soldier a
sword, and each pikeman a pike of 16 foote
long and not und<sup>r</sup>.; and each musqueteer a
musquet with a collar of bandaliers, the barrell
of which musquet to be about foor foote long
and to conteine a bullet, foorteen of which shall
weigh a pound weight<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>."</p>

<p>The ranks of the Troops of Horse were at this
period composed of men of some property&mdash;generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
the sons of substantial yeomen: the young
men received as recruits provided their own horses,
and they were placed on a rate of pay sufficient
to give them a respectable station in society.</p>

<p>On the breaking out of the war with Holland
in the spring of 1672, a Regiment of Dragoons
was raised<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; the Dragoons were placed on a lower
rate of pay than the Horse, and the Regiment
was armed similar to the Infantry, excepting that
a limited number of the men carried halberds
instead of pikes, and the others muskets and bayonets;
and a few men in each troop had pistols;
as appears by a warrant dated the 2nd of April,
1672, of which the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Charles R.</span></p>

<p>"Our will and pleasure is, that a Regiment
of Dragoones which we have established
and ordered to be raised, in twelve Troopes of
fourscore in each beside officers, who are to be
under the command of Our most deare and most
intirely beloved Cousin Prince Rupert, shall
be armed out of Our stoares remaining within
Our office of the Ordinance, as followeth; that
is to say, three corporalls, two serjeants, the
gentlemen at armes, and twelve soldiers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>each of the said twelve Troopes, are to have and
carry each of them one halbard, and one case
of pistolls with holsters; and the rest of the
soldiers of the several Troopes aforesaid, are
to have and to carry each of them one matchlocke
musquet, with a collar of bandaliers, and
also to have and to carry one bayonet<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, or great
knive. That each lieutenant have and carry
one partizan; and that two drums be delivered
out for each Troope of the said Regiment<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Several regiments of Horse and Dragoons
were raised in the first year of the reign of King
James II.; and the horsemen carried a short carbine<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
in addition to the sword and pair of pistols:
and in a Regulation dated the 21st of February,
1687, the arms of the Dragoons at that period
were commanded to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Dragoons to have snaphanse musquets,
strapt, with bright barrels of three foote eight
inches long, cartouch-boxes, bayonetts, granado
pouches, buckets, and hammer-hatchetts."</p>

<p>After several years' experience, little advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>was found to accrue from having Cavalry Regiments
formed almost exclusively for engaging the
enemy on foot; and, the Horse having laid aside
their armour, the arms and equipment of Horse
and Dragoons were so nearly assimilated, that
there remained little distinction besides the name
and rate of pay. The introduction of improvements
into the mounting, arming, and equipment
of Dragoons rendered them competent to the
performance of every description of service required
of Cavalry; and, while the long musket
and bayonet were retained, to enable them to act
as Infantry, if necessary, they were found to be
equally efficient, and of equal value to the nation,
as Cavalry, with the Regiments of Horse.</p>

<p>In the several augmentations made to the
regular Army after the early part of the reign of
Queen Anne, no new Regiments of Horse were
raised for permanent service; and in 1746 King
George II. reduced three of the old Regiments
of Horse to the quality and pay of Dragoons; at
the same time, His Majesty gave them the title of
First, Second, and Third Regiments of <em>Dragoon
Guards</em>: and in 1788 the same alteration was
made in the remaining four Regiments of Horse,
which then became the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and
Seventh Regiments of <em>Dragoon Guards</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span></p>

<p>At present there are only three Regiments
which are styled <em>Horse</em> in the British Army,
namely, the two Regiments of Life Guards, and
the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, to whom
cuirasses have recently been restored. The other
Cavalry Regiments consist of Dragoon Guards,
Heavy and Light Dragoons, Hussars, and Lancers;
and although the long musket and bayonet
have been laid aside by the whole of the Cavalry,
and the Regiments are armed and equipped on
the principle of the old Horse (excepting the
cuirass), they continue to be styled Dragoons.</p>

<p>The old Regiments of Horse formed a highly
respectable and efficient portion of the Army,
and it is found, on perusing the histories of the
various campaigns in which they have been engaged,
that they have, on all occasions, maintained
a high character for steadiness and discipline as
well as for bravery in action. They were formerly
mounted on horses of superior weight and physical
power, and few troops could withstand a
well-directed charge of the celebrated British
Horse. The records of these corps embrace a
period of 150 years&mdash;a period eventful in history,
and abounding in instances of heroism displayed
by the British troops when danger has threatened
the nation,&mdash;a period in which these Regiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
have numbered in their ranks men of loyalty,
valour, and good conduct, worthy of imitation.</p>

<p>Since the Regiments of Horse were formed
into Dragoon Guards, additional improvements
have been introduced into the constitution of the
several corps; and the superior description of
horses now bred in the United Kingdom, enables
the commanding officers to remount their regiments
with such excellent horses, that, whilst
sufficient weight has been retained for a powerful
charge in line, a lightness has been acquired, which
renders them available for every description of
service incident to modern warfare.</p>

<p>The orderly conduct of these Regiments in
quarters has gained the confidence and esteem of
the respectable inhabitants of the various parts of
the United Kingdom in which they have been
stationed; their promptitude and alacrity in attending
to the requisitions of the magistrates in
periods of excitement, and the temper, patience,
and forbearance which they have evinced when
subjected to great provocation, insult, and violence
from the misguided populace, prove the value of
these troops to the Crown, and to the Government
of the country, and justify the reliance which is
reposed on them.</p>

<h2>ON THE INSTITUTION<br />

OF<br />

LIGHT CAVALRY<br />

IN<br />

THE BRITISH ARMY.</h2>


<p>The records of the military events of the remote
ages speak of heavy-armed horsemen being accompanied
by others mounted and equipped for light
services. The Barons and Knights, who rode the
powerful horses celebrated by historians, and took
the field completely cased in steel, had a few
light-armed attendants; the feudal horsemen were
variously armed; and the practice of employing
Light, as well as Heavy Cavalry, was adopted, to
a limited extent, by several commanders of antiquity.
Armour, proof against arrow, lance, and
sword, and men and horses of colossal appearance,
in whom the greatest amount of weight and physical
power, consistent with a moderate share of
activity, could be combined, were however held in
the highest estimation; but eventually the great
advantage of having a portion of Cavalry in which
lightness, activity, and celerity of movement,
might form the principal characteristics, was discovered.
The introduction of fire-arms occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
armour to be gradually laid aside, or limited to a
few heavy horsemen; superiority of weight was
no longer thought so necessary; and in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries the use of Light
Cavalry became more general than formerly.</p>

<p>During the seventy years' war between Spain
and the United Provinces of the Netherlands,
Prince Maurice of Nassau (afterwards Prince of
Orange) selected a few English and Dutch heavy-armed
Lancers, and constituted them <em>Carabineers</em>,
for skirmishing, and other services of a similar
character. The Emperor of Germany formed
regiments of Hungarian <em>Hussars</em>, who were light
men on small horses. The Carabineers were
of an intermediate class, being much heavier
than the Hussars, and lighter than the English
Lancers and Cuirassiers, who rode powerful
horses, and wore armour on the head, body, and
limbs. The French monarchs adopted the practice
of having a few Carabineers in each troop of
Horse; and, in 1690, Louis XIV. added a troop
of Carabineers to each Regiment of Cavalry.
During the campaign of 1691, these troops formed
a Carabineer brigade; but their motley appearance,
and the defects of the plan, occasioned them
to be constituted a regiment of Carabineers,
and clothed in blue. In 1693 the French King
added a regiment of Hussars to the Cavalry of
his army.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In England the same principle was partially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
carried out; the heavy horse laid aside their
armour, excepting cuirasses; they were mounted
on horses of less weight than formerly, and they
were supplied with carbines by King Charles II.
In 1685, King James II. raised several independent
troops of <em>Light Horse</em>, and one of them (Sir
Thomas Burton's) was retained in his service until
the Revolution in 1688, when it was disbanded.
In 1691-2 King William III. constituted the
Seventh Regiment of Horse, now Sixth Dragoon
Guards, a corps of Carabineers, as an honorary
distinction, and for the performance of services for
which the other regiments of Horse, being Cuirassiers,
were not well adapted. The object was to
combine with strength and power a greater degree
of activity and speed than was to be found in the
Cavalry at that period; and His Majesty appears
to have contemplated having several corps of this
description in his service, as he designated this
<em>the First Regiment of Carabineers</em>; but no second
regiment was formed.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In 1694 a troop of
foreign Hussars formed part of the Army commanded
by King William in Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>During the wars of Queen Anne the Regiment
of Carabineers was again supplied with cuirasses,
and was mounted on the same description
of horses as the other regiments; retaining, however,
the title of Carabineers. The activity, size,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>weight, and strength of the horses ridden by the
British Cuirassiers and Heavy Dragoons, with the
bravery and muscular powers of the men, established
their superiority in continental warfare
over the Cavalry of other nations; they acquired
great celebrity in the valley of the Danube and
on the plains of the Netherlands, in the early part
of the eighteenth century, under the renowned
John Duke of Marlborough; and after the peace
of Utrecht, in 1713, the reputation of the British
Horse and Dragoons was so high that no alteration
was thought necessary, and many years
elapsed without any attempt being made to revive
the practice of having either Carabineers, or
Light Horse, in the British Army.</p>

<p>The great utility of the Light Cavalry of the
continental armies had, in the mean time, become
apparent. Improvements in military tactics, and
in the arming and equipment of corps, were
taking place in various countries; and a spirit of
emulation extending itself to Great Britain, on
the breaking out of the rebellion in 1745, his
Grace the Duke of Montague evinced his loyalty
and public spirit by raising a Regiment of <em>Carabineers</em>
for the service of King George II.; at the
same time, his Grace the Duke of Kingston, with
equal zeal and generosity, raised, at his own expense,
a Regiment of <em>Light Horse</em>. The latter regiment
approximated, in the lightness of the men,
horses, and equipment, to the Hussars of the continental
armies; the Duke of Montague's Carabineers
were of a heavier description of Cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>At this period the old Cavalry Regiments rode
black horses (excepting the Scots Greys) with
docked tails; but the Duke of Kingston's Regiment
was mounted on light horses of various
colours, with swish or nag tails. The accoutrements
were as light as possible: the men carried
short carbines slung to their sides by a moveable
swivel, pistols, and light swords inclined to a curve.</p>

<p>The usefulness of the Duke of Kingston's
Regiment of Light Horse was proved in Scotland,
where it served under His Royal Highness the
Duke of Cumberland, and was found qualified
for every description of service; the light horses
traversing hilly grounds with facility. It distinguished
itself on several occasions, particularly
at the battle of Culloden, on the 16th of April,
1746, when it charged the clans with signal gallantry,
and evinced great spirit and activity in the
pursuit of the rebel army upwards of three miles
from the field of battle. The Duke of Cumberland
was highly pleased with its behaviour during
the period it was under his command; and the
conduct of the Light Horse throughout the contest
reflected credit on the noble peer who had
raised them.</p>

<p>The rebellion being suppressed, the regiment
was, in consequence of the conditions on which
the men had enlisted, directed to be disbanded;
but the Duke of Cumberland so highly approved
of its conduct that he obtained permission to embody
as many of the men as would re-enlist, as
his own Regiment of Light Dragoons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>His Majesty's thanks and particular satisfaction
were communicated to His Grace the Duke
of Kingston, for his zeal and affection for His
Majesty's person and Government; and His
Grace was desired to convey to the officers and
soldiers His Majesty's high sense of their loyalty,
activity, and gallant behaviour, at a period of
national danger. The regiment was afterwards
disbanded at Nottingham, and nearly every man
engaged in the Regiment of Light Dragoons, of
which, as a signal mark of honour and distinction,
His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland
was appointed Colonel.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland's Light Dragoons
were mounted on active nag-tailed horses, from
fourteen and a half to fifteen hands high. The
men were from five feet eight to five feet nine
inches in height; and their equipment was upon
a new and light plan, but retaining the cocked
hat of the Heavy Dragoon pattern. This regiment
served in the Netherlands, with the Army
commanded by His Royal Highness the Duke
of Cumberland: its general usefulness was fully
established, and it distinguished itself at the
battle of Val, in 1747. The treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle
having put an end to the war, it returned
to England, and was disbanded in 1749.</p>

<p>From this period the value of light horsemen
was more appreciated in England than formerly;
the general utility of this arm, on home and
foreign service, had been fully proved; and at
the commencement of hostilities with France, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
1755, King George II. resolved to possess the
advantage of a body of Light Cavalry in the
approaching contest. His Majesty accordingly
commanded <em>a troop of Light Dragoons</em> to be
added to the First, Second, and Third Regiments
of Dragoon Guards, and First, Second, Third,
Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Tenth, and Eleventh
Regiments of Dragoons. The First, Second,
Third, and Fourth Irish Horse (now Fourth,
Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Dragoon Guards),
and the Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, Twelfth, Thirteenth,
and Fourteenth Dragoons, being on the
Irish establishment, did not receive the same
addition.</p>

<p>These troops of Light Dragoons were mounted,
armed, equipped, and trained, according to specific
instructions, calculated to render them available
for the services for which they were designed.
Several of them were reviewed in Hyde Park by
His Majesty; and their neat appearance, celerity
of movement, and the spirited and exact manner
in which they performed their evolutions, were
much admired.</p>

<p>Nine of these troops were formed into a brigade
in 1758, under the command of one of the
King's aides-de-camp, Colonel George Augustus
Eliott, of the Horse Grenadier Guards; and they
were employed in the expeditions to the coast of
France under Charles Duke of Marlborough and
Lieut.-General Bligh. They landed in France
twice; skirmished with the French Cavalry; and
throughout these enterprises they evinced activity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
spirit, and general usefulness. After their return
to England, they were augmented to 125 men
per troop.</p>

<p>At this period, the war on the Continent had
involved most of the European states; and the
extended and active operations which were taking
place in Germany rendered it necessary for a
British force to join the Allied Army under
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. This gave rise
to a further augmentation of the Army; and the
increased estimation in which Light Cavalry was
held induced the King to give directions for the
raising of <em>entire Regiments of Light Dragoons</em>,
in addition to the five Regiments of Horse,
three of Dragoon Guards, and fourteen of Dragoons,
already on the British and Irish establishments.
The following corps were accordingly
embodied:&mdash;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Light Dragoons.</span></h3>


<h4><em>Incorporated in 1759.</em></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Fifteenth</span>, in England, by Colonel George
A. Eliott;&mdash;now the Fifteenth, or the King's
Hussars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sixteenth</span>, in England, by Lieut.-Colonel
John Burgoyne;&mdash;now the Sixteenth, or the
Queen's Lancers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, in Scotland, by Captain Lord
Aberdour;&mdash;disbanded in 1763.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eighteenth</span>, in England, by Lieut.-Colonel
John Hale;&mdash;now the Seventeenth Lancers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nineteenth</span>, in Ireland, by Lieut.-Colonel
Lord Drogheda;&mdash;numbered the Eighteenth in
1763; constituted Hussars in 1807; and after
performing much valuable service at home and
abroad, it was disbanded at Newbridge, in Ireland,
in 1821.</p>


<h4><em>Incorporated in 1760.</em></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Twentieth</span>, in Ireland, by Captain Sir James
Caldwell;&mdash;disbanded in 1763.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-first</span>, or Royal Foresters, in England
by Lieut.-General the Marquis of Granby,
and Colonel Lord Robert Sutton;&mdash;disbanded in
1763.</p>

<p>After the peace of Fontainebleau, three of these
corps were disbanded, and the other four continued
in the service. The light troops attached
to the heavy regiments were also disbanded, but
a few men of each troop were afterwards equipped
as Light Dragoons.</p>

<p>A more perfect knowledge of the efficiency
and capabilities of Light Cavalry, acquired during
the campaigns in Germany and Portugal, had
advanced the estimation in which that arm was
held; and, in 1768, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Dragoons (one
of the heavy regiments raised by King George I.
in 1715), underwent a change of equipment and
clothing, and was constituted a corps of <em>Light
Dragoons</em>, by General Carpenter, in Ireland.</p>

<p>This alteration served as a precedent for subsequent
changes; and further experience, during
the American war, from 1775 to 1783, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>firming
the value of Light Cavalry, the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>,
<span class="smcap">Eighth</span>, <span class="smcap">Ninth</span>, <span class="smcap">Tenth</span>, <span class="smcap">Eleventh</span>, <span class="smcap">Thirteenth</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Fourteenth</span> Regiments of Dragoons were
changed from <em>heavy to light</em>. The Light Dragoons
attached to the heavy regiments were incorporated
into newly-raised corps, and the following
regiments of</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Light Dragoons</span></h3>


<h4><em>Were embodied in 1779.</em></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Nineteenth</span>,&mdash;by Major-General Russell Manners;&mdash;disbanded
in 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twentieth</span>,&mdash;by Major-General Richard Burton
Phillipson;&mdash;disbanded in 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-first</span>,&mdash;by Major-General John Douglas;
&mdash;disbanded in 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-second</span>,&mdash;by Lieut.-Colonel John Lord
Sheffield;&mdash;disbanded in 1783.</p>


<h4><em>Embodied in 1781.</em></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-third</span>,&mdash;by Lieut.-General Sir John
Burgoyne, Baronet, for service in India, and was
numbered the <span class="smcap">Nineteenth</span> after the peace in 1783.
This regiment signalized itself on numerous occasions
in India, and was rewarded with the honour
of bearing on its guidons and appointments the
<em>Elephant</em>, with the words <em>Assaye</em> and <em>Seringapatam</em>.
The word <em>Niagara</em> was also added in commemoration
of the gallantry of two troops, in the year
1813, in North America. In 1817 it was consti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>tuted
a corps of <span class="smcap">Lancers</span>. It was disbanded in
Ireland in 1821.</p>

<p>Thus a few years had produced a great change
in the British Army. Twenty-five years previously
to the termination of the American war
there was not a single Light Dragoon Regiment
in the Service, and in 1783 there were seventeen;
four of them were disbanded at that period, and
thirteen retained in the Service.</p>

<p>Soon after the termination of the American
war, the French monarch having, by aiding the
rebellious British provincials, taught his own subjects
a lesson of insubordination, was deprived of
the reins of government; and the violent conduct
of the French revolutionists in the West Indies
occasioned the <span class="smcap">Twentieth</span> or <span class="smcap">Jamaica Regiment
of Light Dragoons</span> to be raised in 1791 by
Colonel Henry F. Gardner, for service in that
island. Besides its services in Jamaica, detachments
of this regiment served at Malta; Sicily;
at the taking of the Cape of Good Hope, in 1806;
at the capture of Alexandria, in 1807; at the
attack on Monte Video; in Portugal; at Genoa;
and on the eastern coast of Spain; and acquired
the honour of bearing the word <em>Peninsula</em> on its
guidons and appointments. It was disbanded in
Ireland in 1818.</p>

<p>War with France commenced in 1793, and was
followed by augmentations to the Army. It
was not found necessary to add a single Heavy
Cavalry Regiment; but the following Regiments
of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Light Dragoons</span></h3>


<h4><em>Were incorporated in 1794.</em></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-first</span>,&mdash;by Lieut.-Colonel Thomas R.
Beaumont. This regiment served at the Cape of
Good Hope and in India thirteen years; a detachment
was sent to do duty at St. Helena, when
Napoleon Buonaparte was removed thither. This
regiment was disbanded at Chatham in 1820.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-second</span>,&mdash;by Major-General William
Viscount Fielding;&mdash;served in Great Britain and
Ireland;&mdash;disbanded in 1802.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-third</span>,&mdash;by Colonel William Fullerton;&mdash;served
in Great Britain and Ireland;&mdash;disbanded
in 1802.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-fourth</span>,&mdash;by Colonel William Loftus;&mdash;served
in Great Britain and Ireland;&mdash;disbanded
in 1802.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-fifth</span>,&mdash;by Major-General Francis
Edward Gwyn. This regiment was numbered
the <span class="smcap">Twenty-second</span> after the Treaty of Amiens
in 1802. It served with reputation in India; was
employed at the reduction of Java; signalized
itself on several occasions; and was rewarded with
the royal authority to bear the word <em>Seringapatam</em>
on its guidons and appointments. It was disbanded
in England in 1820.</p>


<h4><em>Raised in 1795.</em></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-sixth</span>,&mdash;by Lieut.-General R. Manners;&mdash;numbered
the <span class="smcap">Twenty-third</span> in 1803.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
This regiment served in Egypt, Portugal, Spain,
Flanders, and France; and its distinguished conduct
was rewarded with the honour of bearing
on its guidons and appointments, the <em>Sphinx</em>,
with the words <em>Egypt</em>, <em>Peninsula</em>, and <em>Waterloo</em>.
In 1816 it was constituted a corps of <span class="smcap">Lancers</span>.
It was disbanded in England in 1817.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-seventh</span>,&mdash;by Major-General Wynter
Blathwayte;&mdash;numbered the <span class="smcap">Twenty-fourth</span> in
1804. This regiment served in India, distinguished
itself at the battles of Ghur and Delhi,
and was permitted to bear the <em>Elephant</em>, with
the word <em>Hindoostan</em>, on its guidons and appointments.
It was disbanded in England, on its
arrival from Bengal, in 1819.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-eighth</span>,&mdash;by Major-General Robert
Lawrie;&mdash;served in Great Britain, Ireland, and
at the Cape of Good Hope;&mdash;disbanded in Ireland
in 1802.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-ninth</span>,&mdash;by Major-General Francis
Augustus Lord Heathfield;&mdash;numbered the
<span class="smcap">Twenty-fifth</span> in 1804. This regiment served
in India, and was at the reduction of the Isle of
France. It was disbanded at Chatham, on its
arrival from India, in 1819.</p>

<p><em>Raised in 1794.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thirtieth</span>,&mdash;by Lieut.-Colonel J. C. Carden;&mdash;disbanded
in 1796.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thirty-first</span>,&mdash;by Lieut.-Colonel William St.
Ledger;&mdash;disbanded in 1796.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thirty-second</span>,&mdash;by Lieut.-Colonel H. J.
Blake;&mdash;disbanded in 1796.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thirty-third</span>,&mdash;by Lieut.-Colonel J. Blackwood;&mdash;disbanded
in 1796.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Soon after the re-commencement of hostilities
with France in 1803, the <span class="smcap">Seventh</span>, <span class="smcap">Tenth</span>, <span class="smcap">Fifteenth</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Eighteenth</span> Light Dragoons were
equipped as <span class="smcap">Hussars</span>. Since the termination of
the war in 1815, the <span class="smcap">Third</span> and <span class="smcap">Fourth</span> Dragoons
have been changed from <em>heavy to light</em>; the
<span class="smcap">Ninth</span>, <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>, <span class="smcap">Sixteenth</span>, and <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
Light Dragoons have been constituted <span class="smcap">Lancers</span>;
and the <span class="smcap">Eighth</span> and <span class="smcap">Eleventh</span> Light Dragoons
have also been equipped as <span class="smcap">Hussars</span>.</p>

<p>At this period (1847), the Cavalry of the British
Army consists of twenty-six regiments&mdash;thirteen
Heavy and thirteen Light; and is composed
of three regiments of Cuirassiers, ten of Heavy
Dragoons, four of Light Dragoons, five of Hussars,
and four of Lancers.</p>

<h2>HISTORICAL RECORD<br />

OF THE<br />

THIRD, OR THE KING'S OWN, REGIMENT<br />

OF<br />

LIGHT DRAGOONS.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">1685</div>

<p><span class="smcap">James the Second</span> ascended the throne of
England on the 6th of February, 1685, and four
months only had elapsed, when his nephew,
<span class="smcap">James Duke of Monmouth</span>, erected the standard
of rebellion on the western coast, and, having
been joined by upwards of three thousand men,
proclaimed himself king. To oppose <span class="smcap">Monmouth</span>
and his rash adherents, the King obtained from
Parliament a grant of four hundred thousand
pounds, and augmented the strength of his army.
Among the loyal yeomen and artisans who
arrayed themselves under the banners of their
sovereign, a number of young men from Berkshire,
Middlesex, Herts, and Essex, were formed
into five independent troops of Dragoons under
Captains <span class="smcap">Richard Leveson</span>, <span class="smcap">John Williams</span>,
<span class="smcap">Thomas Hussey</span>, <span class="smcap">Edward Lea</span>, and <span class="smcap">Francis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Russel</span>. These five troops, with an old independent
troop of Dragoons, commanded by
Colonel Strather, were attached to the Royal
Dragoons under <span class="smcap">John Lord Churchill</span>, (afterwards
the great <span class="smcap">Duke of Marlborough</span>,) whose
regiment was thus augmented to nine hundred
men, and from these additional troops the corps
which now bears the distinguished title of the
"<span class="smcap">Third, or King's Own Regiment of Light
Dragoons</span>," derives its origin.</p>

<p>Captain Russel's troop rendezvoused at Chelsea
and Knightsbridge, and having been speedily
mounted and equipped, it was attached to the
three Scots regiments of foot which had arrived
from Holland, and ordered to join the army; but
the insurgent bands having been overthrown at
Sedgemoor on the 6th of July, it halted at Bagshot;
and proceeding to London on the 13th, was
present at the execution of the Duke of Monmouth
on the 15th of that month.</p>

<p>Although the insurrection was thus speedily
suppressed, and the executions which followed
were sufficiently numerous to intimidate the disaffected,
and prevent a second appeal to arms of
a similar character, yet the King resolved to
retain a considerable number of the newly-raised
forces in his service. On the 17th of July several
troops of Dragoons were formed into a regiment,
(now the fourth light dragoons,) under the command
of Colonel John Berkeley; and in the
beginning of August, four of the additional troops
attached to the royal dragoons, with one troop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
from Berkeley's regiment, were incorporated;
at the same time another troop was ordered to be
raised, and the six were constituted a regiment
of which <span class="smcap">His Grace the Duke of Somerset</span>
was appointed Colonel, and <span class="smcap">Alexander Cannon</span>,
from a regiment of foot in the Dutch service,
Lieutenant-Colonel, by commission dated the
2nd of August, 1685. The regiment thus formed
is the subject of this memoir; its Colonel being
Lord-Lieutenant of Somersetshire, had commanded
the militia of that county during the
rebellion, and his regiment was honoured with
the title of the "<span class="smcap">Queen Consort's Regiment
of Dragoons</span>;" and being composed of troops
raised previously to those of Berkeley's regiment,
it obtained precedence of the last-mentioned
corps<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1686</div>

<p>The establishment was fixed by warrant under
the sign manual, bearing date the 1st of January,
1686, from which the following is an extract.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1687</div>

<p>During the summer the regiment was encamped
on Hounslow Heath, where it was reviewed
by the King; it was also encamped on the same
ground in the summer of 1687; and took part
in several mock-engagements, which were exhibited
by an army of upwards of ten thousand men,
in presence of their Majesties, and a numerous
concourse of people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1688</div>

<p>The King, having openly declared himself a
Roman Catholic, resolved to give public audience
to a nuncio from the Pope, Ferdinand d'Adda,
who had been consecrated Archbishop of Amasia
in the King's Chapel at St. James's, and the
<span class="smcap">Duke of Somerset</span>, who was Lord of the Bedchamber
in waiting, was directed to attend the
legate into His Majesty's presence. This com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>mand
his Grace refused to obey, with a laudable
firmness which astonished the King, alleging
the laws of England made such attendance
treason; he was consequently deprived of his
regiment and of his post at court. The King conferred
the Colonelcy on the Lieutenant-Colonel,
<span class="smcap">Alexander Cannon</span>, under whom it was again
encamped on Hounslow Heath.</p>

<p>While pursuing a course of tyrannical and ill-advised
measures against the laws and religion
of the country, the King learnt with astonishment
and indignation, that the Prince of Orange was
embarking an army for England to aid the
noblemen and gentlemen who were opposed to
papacy and arbitrary government; the <span class="smcap">Queen's
Dragoons</span>, with several other corps, were ordered
to Ipswich, under the command of Major-General
Sir John Lanier, to endeavour to preserve Landguard
fort, and to oppose the Prince if he should
attempt to land there. His Highness, however,
landed at Torbay on the 5th of November, 1688,
when the regiment was ordered to Salisbury, and
from thence to Warminster, where the advance-post
of the King's army was established.</p>

<p>While the regiment was stationed at Warminster,
the Lieutenant-Colonel, <span class="smcap">Richard Leveson</span>,
Captain St. George, with several other officers
and a number of men, being stanch Protestants
and zealous advocates for their religion, and for
the welfare of their country, quitted their post
and joined the Prince of Orange. The remainder
of the regiment continued with King James'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
army and retreated towards London. His Majesty
having quitted England and retired to France,
the regiment was re-united at Dunstable, and
the Prince of Orange conferred the colonelcy on
Lieutenant-Colonel <span class="smcap">Leveson</span>, in succession to
Colonel Cannon, who adhered to the interest,
and followed the fortunes of King James.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>On the accession of King William III. and
Queen Mary, the Regiment did not lose its title
of "<span class="smcap">The Queen's</span>," but that designation was not
used, and numerical titles not having been then
introduced, it was usually styled <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span>
regiment; it was, however, again called "<span class="smcap">The
Queen's</span>," after its return from Ireland in 1692.</p>

<p>Under its new sovereign the regiment was
quickly employed in active service. King James
proceeded from France to Ireland, and finding an
army, levied by Earl Tyrconnel, ready to support
the Roman Catholic interest, he soon reduced
the greater part of that country to submission to
his authority. King William sent the veteran
Duke Schomberg with an army to Ireland, to
rescue that country from the power of papacy;
and <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> dragoons embarked at Highlake
on the 21st of August, for the same destination.
Having landed near Carrickfergus, they joined
Duke Schomberg's camp a mile beyond Belfast,
on the 30th of August, and were reviewed on
the following day.</p>

<p>The army quitted Belfast on the 2nd of September,
and advancing towards Newry on the
3rd, found the town in flames, and the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
fled; <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> troopers and some Inniskilling
horse, rode forward in pursuit, but were unable
to overtake the rear of the fugitive army.</p>

<p>A camp was afterwards formed at Dundalk,
and, on the 13th of September, as a party of the
regiment was cutting forage in the fields, a detachment
of the enemy appeared; the dragoons
instantly threw down their forage and advanced
to meet their opponents, who, though superior in
numbers, faced about and retired. On the 21st
of September the enemy appeared in force, displaying
their royal standard, but retired without
venturing to attack the camp; when a party of
<span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> Dragoons galloped forward in pursuit,
and overtaking the enemy's rear, killed five
men. On the 17th of October, as a detachment
of the regiment and some Inniskilling horse,
were reconnoitring, they advanced with great
audacity to the immediate vicinity of King
James' camp, and a party of Irish horse gained a
pass in their rear to cut off their retreat; but the
gallant dragoons, by a determined charge forced
their way through the defile, killed four opponents,
and brought off six prisoners.</p>

<p>These instances of bravery gave Duke Schomberg
a high opinion of the regiment, and about
midnight on the 27th of October, he sent out
two hundred of <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> troopers with some
Inniskilling horse and French protestants, who
dashed across the country to the neighbourhood
of <em>Ardee</em>, routed the enemy's out-guards, and
captured a drove of oxen and some horses, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
which they returned in triumph to the camp at
Dundalk.</p>

<p>In November the army went into winter quarters
in the north of Ireland, and a party of
<span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> troopers was stationed at a frontier
post at Tandrogee. On the 26th of November,
sixty men of the regiment accompanied Colonel
Cambron, while making a reconnoisance of the
enemy's post at <em>Charlemont</em>; when they discovered
a party from the garrison posted in the hedges
near the place. The Dragoons, with their characteristic
intrepidity, dismounted, drove the
enemy from the hedges in gallant style, killed
seven men upon the spot, and captured two Irish
musketeers, twenty horses, and a number of cattle,
with the loss of one man who was killed by a
shot from the town, and eight men, whose ardour
led them too forward in the pursuit, and who
were surrounded and made prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>In February, one squadron of the regiment
formed part of a reconnoitring party under Major-General
Sir John Lanier; and on arriving in
the vicinity of Dundalk, <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> dragoons dismounted,&mdash;stormed
<em>Bedloe's Castle</em>,&mdash;killed ten
of the garrison,&mdash;took the remainder prisoners,&mdash;and
burnt the building. The same party captured
about fifteen hundred head of cattle, and
afterwards returned to Newry,&mdash;having lost one
lieutenant, three dragoons, and four horses, killed,
in this expedition.</p>

<p>Although no general engagement had occurred,
<span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> dragoons, by their spirited conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
on all occasions, had become celebrated in the
army; Colonel <span class="smcap">Leveson</span> was foremost on every
occasion of danger, the men were proud of their
commander, and the character of the corps was
already established, when King William III. arrived
in Ireland to command the Army in person.
His Majesty landed at Carrickfergus on the 14th
of June, and proceeded from thence to Belfast,
where he was met by the principal officers of the
army. <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> troopers were, at this time, at
Newry, with a division of the army commanded
by Major-General Kirke; and on Sunday, the
22nd of June, a squadron of the regiment, under
the orders of Captain Crow, and a company of
Kirke's (now second) foot, commanded by Captain
Farlow, were ordered forward to reconnoitre
the enemy's camp at Dundalk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>This party was on the march at an early hour,
and having advanced through a pass, to the
grounds where the enemy had erected a fort
in the preceding campaign, but had afterwards
abandoned it, they were suddenly saluted by a
volley from some infantry who had concealed
themselves in the fort; at the same time five
hundred of the enemy's horse were seen through
the misty dawn advancing to charge them.
Never were men in greater danger than that
to which this little band was exposed; <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span>
troopers, being in advance, stood their ground
boldly, but were driven back by the superior
numbers of their antagonists. The enemy's horsemen
being checked by the fire of Farlow's mus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>keteers,
the dragoons returned to the charge and
used their broad swords with good effect; the
pikemen joined in the charge and the Irish were
driven back; but not knowing the numbers of
their opponents, the dragoons and pikemen retired
through the pass in good order. The loss
on this occasion was twenty-two men killed and
several wounded, and Captain Farlow, who commanded
the foot, was taken prisoner. The enemy's
loss was greater, and their Commanding
Officer was killed by one of <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> troopers.
Another party of the regiment was sent forward
on the following morning, and ascertained that
the enemy had left the camp at Dundalk, and
were retreating towards Ardee.</p>

<p>King William advanced through Dundalk to
Ardee, which town he entered as the enemy's
rear-guard abandoned the place. On the 30th of
June he arrived at the river <em>Boyne</em>, and Captain
Pownell, of <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> dragoons, was sent with a
squadron to take post near Slane-bridge. King
James' army was strongly posted on the opposite
bank of the river, with his right near Drogheda
and his left extending towards the village of Slane.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July the river was crossed at
three places, and a general engagement was
fought. After a severe struggle the enemy retreated
to the village of Donore, where they
made such a determined stand that the Dutch
and Danish horse, though headed by the King in
person, gave way; when a squadron of <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span>
dragoons, commanded by Captain Brewer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>ton,
and a party of Sir Albert Cunningham's
dragoons (the sixth Inniskilling) dismounted,
and, lining the hedges, and an old house, 'did
such execution upon the pursuers as soon checked
their ardour.' At the same time Colonel
<span class="smcap">Leveson</span>, with the remainder of his regiment,
galloped forward, and, with admirable bravery,
interposed between the enemy's horse, and the
village of Duleck. King William's horse having
rallied and returned to the charge, the enemy
retreated, when they were attacked in the rear by
Colonel <span class="smcap">Leveson</span> with his dragoons, who made
great slaughter. The Irish abandoned the field
with precipitation; but their French and Swiss
auxiliaries retreated in good order.</p>

<p>King James returned to France, yet the war
was continued in Ireland. On the 22nd of July,
<span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> dragoons proceeded, with other forces,
to <em>Waterford</em>, and invested the town. The
garrison surrendered on the 25th, and was conducted
to <em>Youghal</em> by a troop of the regiment
under Captain Pownell. Having delivered up
his charge, the captain, representing to the governor
the ruin he would bring upon himself if
he held out, induced him to deliver up the place;
and it was taken possession of the same night by
the dragoons, who found fourteen pieces of cannon,
350 barrels of oats, and some provisions, in
the town. This troop remained in garrison at
Youghal, with a company of foot; and the commanding
officer, having heard that bands of
armed Roman Catholic peasantry, called Rappa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>rees,
were committing ravages on the Protestants,
marched out with thirty-six dragoons and fifty
foot. The dragoons were in advance, and when
they arrived near <em>Castle Martir</em>, they encountered
three hundred rapparees. Notwithstanding the
disparity of numbers, the gallant dragoons dashed
forward sword in hand,&mdash;broke in upon the enemy,&mdash;sabred
sixty upon the spot, and took seventeen
prisoners. The foot having come up, the
castle was summoned, and the troops in the garrison
delivered it up on condition of being allowed
to march unmolested to Cork, without horses
and arms. The captain gave the arms to the
Protestant inhabitants, and took the horses with
him to Youghal.</p>

<p>At this time the remainder of the regiment was
engaged in the siege of <em>Limerick</em>, which failed,
owing to the loss of the battering train. From
Limerick the five troops marched with other corps
towards <em>Birr</em>, to relieve the castle, which was
besieged by the enemy; and, after performing
this service, encamped beyond the town.</p>

<p>On the 16th of September one troop of the
regiment attacked an immense number of rapparees
who were proceeding from Cork to Lismore,
and having routed them and killed forty, took
three prisoners. Two days afterwards, as Lieutenant
Kelly of the regiment was out with a
small party reconnoitring, he was surrounded
and taken prisoner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691</div>

<p>The regiment passed a part of the winter at
Clonmel, and in February 1691, it was employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
on an expedition to <em>Streamstown</em>, when the advanced
guard highly distinguished itself; and
shortly afterwards its colonel, the gallant <span class="smcap">Leveson</span>,
was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general.
In May it was encamped at Mullingar.</p>

<p>The Irish being strengthened from France,
and the English from Scotland, both armies took
the field in the beginning of June, when General
De Ginkell, who was left in command by King
William, advanced through Mullingar,&mdash;captured
Ballymore, and besieged Athlone, which
was gallantly stormed and taken on the 30th of
June. The town having been put in a posture
of defence, the army advanced to Ballinasloe,
and on Sunday, the 12th of July, advanced in
four columns against the Irish, who were strongly
posted near the village of <em>Aghrim</em>; their right
flank and centre being covered by a morass, and
the remainder of their front by enclosures, terminating
at the castle of Aghrim, on which their
left rested. <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> troopers were formed in
brigade with the royal Irish dragoons commanded
by Brigadier-General Villiers, and posted on the
right of the line. The action was well contested
on both sides. At length the Blues, Langston's,
and Byerley's horse, a squadron of Ruvigny's
French Protestants, and <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> dragoons,
forced the pass at the castle of Aghrim, and, by
a gallant charge, decided the fate of the day.
<span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> gallant troopers rushed forward with
their wonted bravery, and overthrew all opposition.
In opposing this attack in person, the ene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>my's
general, <span class="smcap">St. Ruth</span>, was killed by a cannon
ball, and the Irish giving way, were pursued
with great slaughter by the cavalry towards
Loughrea. The regiment was thanked by the
Commander-in-Chief for its excellent conduct.
It lost in this action seven men killed, and five
wounded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leveson's</span> dragoons were afterwards employed
in the siege of <em>Galway</em>. On the 2nd of August
they were detached, with twenty-four men from
each regiment of Horse, under the command of
Brigadier-General Leveson, to scour the country
and drive in the enemy's parties; and they arrived
on the 4th, in the vicinity of <em>Nenagh</em>,
where five hundred of the enemy, under Brigadier-General
Carrol (commonly called Tall Anthony)
were in garrison in an old castle, on the
domain of the Duke of Ormond. Part of the
garrison occupied a pass half a mile in front of
the castle; but was driven from that post by the
dragoons. The garrison made a precipitate retreat
towards Limerick, but were overtaken at
<em>Cariganlis</em>, and routed with the loss of several
men, their baggage, and four hundred head of
cattle.</p>

<p>The siege of <em>Limerick</em> commenced on the 25th
of August, and the regiment was before the town
until the 31st, when it was detached with a party
of horse under Brigadier-General <span class="smcap">Leveson</span>, and
Major Wood of the eighth horse (now sixth dragoon
guards) to reduce the small garrisons in the
county of Kerry, where the whole country was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
found in arms, and Lords Merrion's and Bretta's
regiments of Irish horse there to assist the rapparees.
<span class="smcap">Leveson</span> and <span class="smcap">Wood</span><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> were both daring
aspirants for military fame, and had become
celebrated for their zeal and valour, and for their
abilities on detached services.&mdash;Having ascertained
where the two Irish regiments were encamped,
they marched all the night of the 1st
of September; and about one on the following
morning, rushed suddenly upon them with the
horse and dragoons. The enemy, surprised and
confounded, fled in every direction, pursued by
the victorious dragoons, who sabred many men
and captured a drove of oxen. A reinforcement
of three hundred horse and dragoons and six
pieces of cannon was afterwards sent to Brigadier-General
<span class="smcap">Leveson</span>, and he reduced several garrisons
between Cork and Limerick, and sent numbers
of oxen and sheep to the army. On the
22nd of September this gallant officer, with only
two hundred and fifty horse and dragoons, attacked
and dispersed two regiments of Irish dragoons
and a body of rapparees nearly three thousand
strong; when he again captured some cattle
and sheep. It appears that the principal part of
the provisions for the army encamped before
Limerick was supplied by the activity of <span class="smcap">Leveson's</span>
corps, which continued to act as an independent
force until the surrender of that city on
the 3rd of October. In King James's declaration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>from St. Germains, Brigadier-General <span class="smcap">Leveson</span>
was especially exempted from the general amnesty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1692</div>

<div class="sidenote">1693</div>

<p>With the fall of Limerick ended the war in
Ireland<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; and the regiment having embarked for
England, landed at Barnstaple on the 18th of
March, 1692. Its establishment was six troops,
360 men, and its expense 15,999<em>l.</em> 3<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> per
annum. During this and the following year
it was stationed in the south and western counties
of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1694</div>

<p>On the 19th of January, 1694, Brigadier-General
Leveson was removed to the third horse, now
second dragoon guards; and the colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons was conferred upon <span class="smcap">Thomas,
Lord Fairfax</span>, from lieut.-colonel of the second
troop (now second regiment) of life guards.</p>

<p>At this period King William was engaged in
a war with France, and the third horse and
<span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons having been reviewed by His
Majesty in Hyde Park, on the 26th of March
embarked for foreign service. The <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons
landed at Williamstadt, in North Brabant,
on the 16th of April 1694, joined the army encamped
at Tirlemont on the 21st of June, and
was again reviewed by His Majesty on the following
day. Its excellent conduct in Ireland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
appears to have raised the regiment high in the
King's estimation, and it was ordered to encamp
beyond the defiles of the village of Roosebeck, to
cover His Majesty's quarters<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<p>The regiment served the campaign of this year
in brigade with the royals and royal Scots dragoons,
and was employed in manœuvring and
skirmishing in the valleys of Brabant and in the
verdant plains of Flanders. No general engagement
occurred, and in October it went into quarters
at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1695</div>

<p>In February, 1695, Lord Fairfax having retired,
King William conferred the colonelcy on Colonel
<em>William Lloyd</em>: at the same time the establishment
was augmented to eight troops of thirty-eight
officers, seventy-two non-commissioned officers,
and four hundred and eighty privates, the annual
expense being increased to 20,652<em>l.</em> 18<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em></p>

<p>Having passed the winter in barracks at Ghent
and received a remount from England, the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>
dragoons marched, in April 1695, to Dixmude in
West Flanders, and encamped on the plains of the
Yperlee. A small detached corps was assembled
at this place under Major-General Ellemberg, and
in June an attack was made on the forts at
Kenoque, to draw the French troops that way, and
to facilitate the siege of Namur, which was undertaken
immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons, with eight battalions of
infantry, returned to Dixmude, and the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of the division marched to the main army before
Namur.</p>

<p>While the army was besieging Namur, a French
force, commanded by General de Montal, invested
Dixmude (15th July), and carried on the approaches
with great expedition. The governor,
Major-General Ellemberg, called a council of war,
and suggested the expediency of surrendering.
This was opposed by Major Beaumont, who commanded
the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, and some other
officers, but it was agreed to by the majority, and
the garrison was delivered up prisoners of war.
Thus, the gallant dragoons, after displaying the
greatest valour in former campaigns, were tamely
consigned into the hands of the enemy, by a timid,
or treacherous, foreign general officer. The soldiers
were enraged at not being permitted to
defend the place; many of the men broke their
arms before they delivered them up, and one
British regiment tore its colours to pieces.</p>

<p>An agreement had previously been made by
the contending powers, that all prisoners should
be given up on certain conditions. These conditions
were complied with, and the return of the
regiments which had surrendered, was demanded;
but the French court refused to give them up.
At length the citadel of Namur capitulated, and
the French garrison was permitted to march out
without being made prisoners, but as they passed
through the allied army, their commander, Marsha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>l
Boufflers, was arrested and detained until the
conditions of the agreement were complied with.
The detention of the marshal produced the release
of the regiments; the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons returned
to the army, and were ordered into barracks at
Ghent. At the same time a general court-martial
assembled for the trial of the officers who had
delivered the regiments into the power of the
enemy. The governor of Dixmude, Major-General
Ellemberg, was sentenced to be beheaded, and was
executed at Ghent on the 20th of November.
Colonels Graham, O'Farrell, Lesly, and Aver,
were cashiered; two others were suspended, and
the remainder acquitted. After the army left
the field, the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons were quartered in
villages near the canal of Sluys.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1696</div>

<p>The regiment again took the field in May 1696,
and was reviewed by King William on the 29th
of that month, when it appeared complete in
numbers, and in excellent condition. During the
summer it formed part of a detached corps commanded
by Major-General Fagel, and encamped
near Nieuport. The enemy made demonstrations
of an attack on this part of the country, when
entrenchments were thrown up, the sluices were
opened, and the grounds in front of the French
army were laid under water. A few skirmishes
were, however, all that occurred; and in the early
part of October the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons marched
into quarters on the frontiers of Dutch Flanders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1697</div>

<div class="sidenote">1698</div>

<p>After leaving its village cantonments in the
early part of April 1697, the regiment was en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>camped
at Bois-Seigneur-Isaac; it was afterwards
employed in operations in Brabant, and on
the 27th of May it formed part of a detachment
of seven squadrons, commanded by Major-General
de Bay, sent from the camp at Promelles
towards Binche and Herlaymonte-Capelle. When
on the march, the advance-guard, consisting of a
squadron of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>, commanded by Colonel
Lloyd, encountered a squadron of French carabineers,
whom the dragoons overthrew and put to
flight, killing and wounding many men, and
taking an officer and seventeen soldiers prisoners.
The regiment was subsequently employed in
covering Brussels, until the treaty of Ryswick
restored peace to Europe; when it left the Netherlands
and returned to England. In the
following year the establishment was reduced to
six troops&mdash;286 private men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702</div>

<p>The regiment remained in England until the
summer of 1702, when, war having been declared
against France and Spain, an expedition, commanded
by the Duke of Ormond, was sent against
<em>Cadiz</em>, and a detachment of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons,
consisting of three field-officers, three captains,
four lieutenants, five cornets, three staff-officers,
five quarter-masters, five serjeants, fourteen corporals,
eight drummers, and one hundred and
eighty-six private men<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, was embarked for this
service. A landing was effected on the coast of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>Spain, near Cadiz, on the 15th of August; on the
following day Rota, a town on the north side of
the bay seven miles from Cadiz, was taken, and on
the 21st, Port St. Mary's, situate at the mouth of
the river Guadalete, was captured. The <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>
dragoons, being the only cavalry with the expedition,
were almost constantly employed on piquet
and outpost duty. On the 25th of August the
army encamped at <em>Santa Victoria</em>, and in the
early part of September the attack of the Matagorda
was commenced. 'On the 5th of September
a squadron of Spanish horse made bold
to attack a small party of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons,
who behaved themselves so gallantly, that they
put the enemy to flight, having wounded and
taken an officer and two men with their horses,
and on our side we had a cornet and a private
man killed, and a lieutenant taken, whom the
Spaniards, against all the laws of nations and
arms, most barbarously cut in pieces<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.'</p>

<p>Cadiz was found better prepared for a siege
than had been expected, and the troops were re-embarked.
A successful attack was afterwards
made on the fort of Vigo in Galicia, and a rich
fleet was captured in the harbour, for which the
<span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons received 187<em>l.</em> 3<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> prize
money<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1703</div>

<p>On the 31st of December, 1703, Brigadier-General
(afterwards <span class="smcap">Lord</span>) <span class="smcap">Carpenter</span>, was appointed
to the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Queen's Dragoons</span>,
by purchase<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, in succession to Major-General
Lloyd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1706</div>

<p>The regiment remained on home service until
1706, when another detachment of about two
hundred and forty officers and men embarked on
board the fleet of Sir Cloudesley Shovel; forming
part of a force of 10,000 men commanded by the
Earl Rivers, and designed to invade the coast of
France, on a plan suggested by the Marquis De
Guiscard. The descent was, however, rendered
impracticable by contrary winds, and the troops
were ordered to Lisbon. In the meantime the
English forces in Spain had retired from Madrid
to Valencia and Catalonia, and the troops under
the Earl Rivers were directed to proceed thither.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons, and other forces, were
accordingly re-embarked; they left Portugal in
the early part of January, 1707, and, having landed
at Alicant in Valencia on the 11th of February,
commenced their march to join the forces under
the Earl of Galway,&mdash;the united camp being
formed at Caudete, on the 30th of March. The
army soon afterwards destroyed several of the
enemy's magazines, and besieged Villena in
Murcia. Meanwhile the French and Spanish
forces, commanded by the Duke of Berwick, advanced
to the plains of <em>Almanza</em>, where the allies
resolved to attack them on the 25th of April.</p>

<p>After a march of fifteen miles through a rugged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and mountainous country, the wearied British and
Portuguese troops entered an open plain between
Caudete and Almanza, where the enemy, superior
in numbers and artillery, was formed in order
of battle. After a short halt the attack was commenced,
and the detachments of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> and
Essex's (now the fourth) dragoons particularly
distinguished themselves; being ordered to charge
a battery of guns, so placed on the brow of a hill,
that the artillery mules, though concealed from
sight, remained close to the guns and could be
instantly attached to them. The charge was
made with determined gallantry, but the guns
being quickly withdrawn, ten squadrons of select
Spanish cavalry charged the British dragoons,
amounting only to about two hundred and
ninety men, killing Lieutenant-Colonel Lawrence
of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>, who led the attack, also Captain
Smith and Cornet Petty of the same corps, and
nearly annihilating the two squadrons. The
greater part of the Portuguese cavalry fled from
the field in a panic, when the British infantry
were nearly surrounded, but the cavalry, by a
desperate charge, in which three generals (Brigadier-General
Carpenter of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> being one)
and thirty-four officers fought in the front ranks,
succeeded in breaking through the enemy. The
Earl of Galway was wounded, and in danger of
being taken prisoner; but the spirited conduct of
the dragoons enabled him to effect his escape<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>and he retreated with the remains of the English
and Dutch cavalry to Alceira, where he received
information that the greater part of the infantry,
after retreating to the hills of Caudete, had been
surrounded and compelled to surrender prisoners
of war.</p>

<p>After this disaster, the few troops which remained
were employed in defensive operations
for the preservation of Catalonia. The <span class="smcap">Queen's</span>
dragoons were stationed a short time at Manresa
on the river Cardener, to refresh their horses; and
after the fall of Lerida, the army went into winter
quarters. The Earl of Galway embarked for
Lisbon, and Brigadier-General Carpenter remained
in command of the troops in Catalonia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons had suffered so severely
at the battle of Almanza, that the officers were
sent to England in March 1708, and the regiment
was ordered to be recruited to sixty men per troop.
The recruiting was carried on with rapidity, and
the difference in the state of the regiment may be
seen from two different returns in one year; in the
first its numbers are 150, and in the second 303.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1709</div>

<div class="sidenote">1710</div>

<div class="sidenote">1711</div>

<div class="sidenote">1712</div>

<div class="sidenote">1713</div>

<p>In 1709 the regiment mustered 443 men, and
it continued at the same number during the two
following years; but in October 1712 a reduction
of ten men per troop took place. In 1713 it was
quartered in North Britain, and mustered 339 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714</div>

<p>After the accession of King George I. in 1714
there being no Queen Consort on the throne, the
regiment was honoured with the distinguished title
of <span class="smcap">The King's Own Regiment of Dragoons</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1715</div>

<p>In the summer of 1715 the regiment marched
to Glasgow, in consequence of disturbances in
that neighbourhood; and on the 8th of September
it joined the camp at Stirling under Major-General
Whetham, which was formed to oppose
the Earl of Mar, who had raised the standard of
rebellion, and proclaimed the Pretender at Aberdeen,
Dundee, and Perth. The Duke of Argyle
afterwards reviewed the troops at Stirling, as
Commander-in-Chief in Scotland.</p>

<p>On the 10th of November His Grace, having
intelligence of the design of the rebels to endeavour
to pass the Forth and to penetrate towards
England, resolved to prevent them, and immediately
gave orders to his troops to hold themselves
in readiness. An order of battle was issued,
in which this regiment and Kerr's dragoons (the
seventh) formed the extreme left; and according
to that order, the army marched from Stirling on
the 12th, and encamped on a rising ground to the
east of Dumblain, between the town and Sheriffmuir.
On the 13th the battle of <span class="smcap">Sheriffmuir</span>
was fought, when each party had one wing defeated
and one victorious. The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>
dragoons were in the left wing; about six hundred
highlanders surprised the infantry of that wing,
in the act of forming, and put it into confusion;
but upon the dragoons charging and defeating
the rebel cavalry opposed to them, capturing their
standard, the rebel infantry pursued their advantage
no further, and Captain Armstrong, who
was sent with orders from the Duke of Argyle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
being killed, the infantry retired in good order.
Both sides claimed the victory; but all the advantage
remained with the Duke of Argyle, who
captured the royal standard of the rebels, called
"The Restoration," also six pieces of cannon,
four waggons, and a number of prisoners. On
the following day the army returned to Stirling,
and awaited the arrival of reinforcements from
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716</div>

<p>On the 9th of January, 1716, the Duke called
a council of war at Stirling, where an order of battle
was issued, in which <span class="smcap">Carpenter's</span> dragoons were
again placed on the left of the front line. Owing
to the roads being rendered impassable by the
snow, no advance was made till Tuesday the 29th,
when the whole army advanced to Dumblain, and
thence, on the 30th, to Tullibardine. At one in
the morning of the 1st of February, the Duke with
his cavalry entered Perth, where he was joined in
the evening by his infantry; the next day he
advanced to Errol, and on the 5th, with all his
cavalry, moved towards Brechin; General Cadogan
leading the infantry to Aberbrothock. On
the 8th Aberdeen was occupied, and it being
ascertained that the Pretender had retired to
France, and that the rebel force had totally dispersed,
the army went into winter quarters, and
the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> dragoons were stationed at
Elgin.</p>

<p>From this time the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> do not appear
to have been engaged in any service of importance
for a period of more than twenty years. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
usually stationed in the southern and western
counties of England; but occasionally occupied
quarters, for short periods, in Scotland. In 1718
the establishment was reduced ten men per troop;
in the following year the numbers were only 186;
an addition of 21 men was made in 1720, and
during that and the two succeeding years the
regiment mustered 207 men.</p>

<p>In 1723 the establishment was augmented to
333 men, at which number it remained, with an
alteration only of six men, until 1727, when the
regiment was ordered to hold itself in readiness
to embark for Holland, as part of the complement
of 10,000 men which England had engaged to
furnish the States; at the same time its establishment
was augmented to 552 men. No embarkation,
however, took place; and in 1729, the
numbers of the regiment were reduced to 309.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1732</div>

<p>After the decease of General Lord Carpenter
in 1732, King George II. conferred the colonelcy
on Major-General <span class="smcap">Philip Honeywood</span>, from the
eleventh dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1738</div>

<div class="sidenote">1739</div>

<p>An augmentation was made to the establishment
in 1738; in 1739, the breaking out of a
war with Spain occasioned general orders for
recruiting to be issued:&mdash;the establishment of
the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> dragoons was raised to 435 men,
and in the summer they were encamped on Hounslow
Heath, where they were several times reviewed
by the Duke of Cumberland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1740</div>

<div class="sidenote">1741</div>

<p>During the summer of 1740, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>
were encamped in Windsor Forest; and in 1741,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
they were ordered, with several other regiments
and a train of artillery, amounting nearly to
10,000 men, to prepare for embarkation for
foreign service. This force encamped in July, on
ground cleared for the purpose, on Lexdon heath,
near Colchester: no embarkation, however, took
place, and after a few weeks, the troops went
into quarters in the various towns in the neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742</div>

<p>In the meantime war was raging on the continent;
the King of France and the Elector of
Bavaria had united to deprive the Archduchess
Maria Theresa of her hereditary dominions; and in
1742, His Britannic Majesty sent sixteen thousand
British troops to Flanders to make a diversion in
favour of the Austrians. The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> Regiment
of dragoons was one of the corps selected for
this service, and having been reviewed on Blackheath
by King George II., accompanied by the
Duke of Cumberland, it embarked shortly afterwards
at Woolwich and Deptford; their colonel,
Lieutenant-General Honeywood, taking the command
of the expedition until the arrival of Field
Marshal the Earl of Stair.</p>

<p>After landing at Ostend the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> dragoons
advanced a few leagues up the country, but
all active operations were prevented by the tardiness
of the Dutch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1743</div>

<p>Early in 1743, the British troops moved from
their cantonments towards the Rhine; the <span class="smcap">King's
Own</span>, and four companies of the foot guards,
forming the advance-guard of the army, were at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
St. Trond, in the province of Limburg, on the 9th
of February, and on the 11th resumed their march
for Germany. In May, the regiment, with the
Inniskilling dragoons, and four battalions of the
foot guards, formed a detached camp a little below
the town of Hochst, in the duchy of Nassau on
the Maine, and was afterwards encamped at Aschaffenburg
in Franconia, a town situate on a hill
on the side of Maine. In the meantime Lieut.-General
Honeywood had been removed to the
first dragoon guards, and the colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">King's Own</span> conferred on Brigadier-General
<span class="smcap">Humphrey Bland</span>, from the thirteenth dragoons.</p>

<p>His Majesty King George II. having left
England towards the end of May, landed at Helvoetsluys
on the 2nd of June, and joined the army
on the 9th; when he found his forces under considerable
embarrassment, from the French commander
having succeeded in gaining possession of
several important posts on the Maine, by which
means he cut off the supplies of provisions and
forage.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances His Majesty resolved
to march to Hanau, where a reinforcement of
12,000 Hessians and Hanoverians had arrived;
and at daybreak on the 16th of June, the troops
commenced the march along the banks of the
Maine: but scarcely had they proceeded three
leagues when it was ascertained that the enemy
had crossed the river, and was drawn up near
<span class="smcap">Dettingen</span> to dispute the march of the army.</p>

<p>The allies were immediately formed for action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
with their left on the river, and their right extending
to a wood, in which the baggage was placed.
Shortly afterwards the action commenced, when
Lieut.-General Clayton, who commanded the left
wing of infantry, requested some squadrons to
cover his flank, and the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> dragoons were
ordered to this important post, where they suffered
severely, being exposed three hours to the fire of
the French batteries, as well from their front, as
from the other side of the river, which commanded
their flank and rear. At length the regiment was
led forward, and encountering nine squadrons of
household cavalry, the élite of the French army,
charged these celebrated horsemen with a degree
of gallantry truly astonishing. British valour was
most conspicuously displayed; though over-matched
with numbers, and nearly surrounded by
enemies, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> dragoons were seen
nobly contending for victory, and mingled in close
fight with their antagonists, the swift motion of
their glittering sabres showed with what vehemence
the gallant troopers fought for the honour of
their King and country. They cut through their
renowned opponents three times; distinguishing
themselves in the most signal manner under the
eye of their Sovereign, and contributing materially
to the victory gained on that occasion. Their
loss was however great. Of the three cornets who
bore the standards, two were wounded, and the
third, Mr. Child, the brother of Lord Castlemaine,
had two horses killed under him. The standards
were totally destroyed by shot and sabre-cuts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
one of them was only preserved from capture by
the heroism of a private in the regiment, named
<span class="smcap">Thomas Brown</span>, a native of Kirkleatham, in Yorkshire.
This gallant soldier, on the cornet's receiving
a wound in the wrist, and dropping the
standard, attempted to dismount in order to recover
it, but in so doing lost two fingers of his
bridle-hand by a sabre cut, and his horse ran away
with him to the rear of the French lines. Whilst
endeavouring to regain his regiment he perceived
the standard, which the French had succeeded in
capturing by overwhelming numbers, in the custody
of a <em>gendarme</em>, who was conveying it to
the rear. This man he attacked and killed, caught
the standard as it fell, and fixing it between his
leg and the saddle, succeeded in cutting his way
back through the ranks of the enemy: but received,
in so doing, seven wounds in his head, face,
and body, and three balls passed through his hat.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
A letter, in the Gazette of July 16th, states, 'that
in this action Ligonier's horse, (the seventh dragoon
guards,) and the <span class="smcap">Third</span> dragoons suffered
most, and gained great reputation.' The loss of
the <span class="smcap">Third</span> was Lieutenant Baily, one serjeant, two
drummers, thirty-eight private men, and one
hundred and forty-one horses, killed; Major Honeywood<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>Captain Brown, Lieutenant Robinson,
Cornets Dawson, Monteith and O'Carrol, with
three quarter-masters, six serjeants, five drummers,
eighty-six private men, and fifty horses wounded<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.
The victory was most decisive; the French were
completely defeated in their attempt, and were
compelled to recross the Maine with precipitation,
with the loss of many standards, colours, and four
pair of kettle-drums.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> dragoons passed the night
near the field of battle, surrounded by their
ensanguined trophies, and, having marched to
Hanau on the following day, were encamped, for
some time, on the banks of the little river Kinzig,
from whence they advanced with the army,
in the early part of August, for the Rhine; and,
having crossed that river above Mentz, were employed
in operations in West Germany, where
the army was joined by the Dutch auxiliaries.
The enemy's entrenchments at Germersheim, in
the Bavarian circle of the Rhine, were afterwards
destroyed, but no general engagement occurred;
and in the middle of October the army repassed
the Rhine, and marched back to the Netherlands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>in eight divisions<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. The royals, greys,
and <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> dragoons, with the Scots highlanders,
forming the first division, proceeded
through the duchy of Nassau, the provinces of
Limburg, Liege, and South Brabant, to Brussels,
where they arrived on the 16th of November,
and on the following day continued their march
for West Flanders, to pass the winter in quarters
at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744</div>

<p>Notwithstanding its severe loss the regiment
remained in Belgium, and being joined by a
number of recruits, in the spring of 1744, it took
the field, and in June it formed part of the army
encamped on the banks of the Scheldt, near
Oudenarde, in East Flanders. During the summer
it was employed in operations in the province
of Hainault, and in levying contributions in
the French territory towards Lisle. In October
it marched into quarters at Ghent: and by
the Muster Rolls for this year we find its numbers
were 538.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>After leaving their winter quarters about the
middle of April, 1745, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> were
encamped a short time near Brussels, where they
were reviewed by his Royal Highness the Duke
of Cumberland. They were afterwards assembled
with the army at Soignies. The French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
having assembled a numerous army and besieged
Tournay, the Duke of Cumberland resolved to
attempt the relief of that fortress; the army,
accordingly, advanced, and on the 28th of April
took post at Leuse. On the following day a
squadron of the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> was employed,
with other troops, in driving back the enemy's
advanced-posts, and on the 30th the battle of
<em>Fontenoy</em> took place; when the gallant efforts
and brilliant success of the British were rendered
unavailing by the failure of the Dutch. After
an action of several hours the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> dragoons
were ordered forward, and they charged
the enemy with their accustomed gallantry; but
under such disadvantageous circumstances that
their manly efforts only retarded the fate of the
day. The Duke of Cumberland ordered a retreat,
and the army marched to the vicinity
of Aeth. The enemy had great advantage in
numbers, in artillery, and in the favourable
ground they occupied; the loss was nearly equal
on both sides, and the Allies lost no honour,
though compelled to retire. The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>
had nine private men, and twenty-eight horses,
killed; Captain Wade, Quarter-Master Corbidge,
fourteen private men, and thirty-four
horses wounded;&mdash;and Cornet Bland, two non-commissioned-officers,
fifteen men, and twenty-three
horses missing.</p>

<p>The regiment was afterwards encamped on the
banks of the Dender, near Lessines; from whence
it proceeded with the army on the 30th of June,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
to Grammont in West Flanders, and was subsequently
encamped before Brussels.</p>

<p>In the mean time Charles-Edward, eldest son
of the Pretender, had arrived in Scotland, and,
being joined by several of the highland clans, he
asserted his father's pretensions to the throne.
There being few troops in Scotland at this time,
the rebellion soon made alarming progress; when
orders were given for the return of several regiments
from the continent, and the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>
were among the first troops ordered home.</p>

<p>Having embarked at Williamstadt, the regiment,
after a boisterous passage, arrived in the
River Thames on the 25th of October, and
immediately landed and proceeded towards the
north. On the 10th of November it joined the
army of Lieutenant-General Sir John Ligonier,
then assembling near Lichfield. On the advance
of the rebels towards Derby, the regiment formed
part of the army commanded by his Royal Highness
the Duke of Cumberland; and when the
highlanders retreated towards Scotland, it was
sent in pursuit. It left Lichfield on this service
on the 9th of November; on the 11th, it was at
Macclesfield; on the 13th at Wigan, and on the
evening of the 19th&mdash;after ten hours' march&mdash;it
arrived on <em>Clifton Moor</em>, three miles from
Penrith; at the same time the rear-guard of the
rebel army, consisting of two battalions of highlanders
and some hussars, occupied the village,
and lined the hedges on both sides of the road.</p>

<p>The sun had set; the shades of evening were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
gathering over the little village of Clifton, and
distant objects were scarcely discernible, when
the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>, and a few detachments from
other corps, forming the advance-guard of the
royal army, having dismounted, proceeded in
compact order to attack the rebels. As the
troops approached the enclosures, the highlanders
opened a sharp fire, which re-echoed along the
vale, and was soon answered by volleys of musketry
from the dragoons. After several rounds,
the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> were ordered to retire a few
paces; when the highlanders, mistaking this for
a flight, raised a loud shout and rushed forward
with sword and pistol; but they were well received
by the dragoons with their broad-swords,
and a fierce combat ensued, hand to hand, both
sides displaying great bravery. Some of the
highlanders broke their swords on the steel caps
of the dragoons, when they drew their daggers,
and continued the fight with great obstinacy.
Eventually, however, the dragoons proved victorious,
and the rebels made a precipitate retreat to
Penrith. The loss of the King's forces on this
occasion was twelve men killed and twenty-five
wounded, amongst whom were four officers of
the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>, viz., Lieutenant-Colonel Honeywood<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>,
Captain East, and Cornets Owen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>Hamilton. The rebels had about twenty killed,
and Captain Hamilton of the hussars with about
seventy men taken prisoners<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> afterwards marched in pursuit
of the rebels to Carlisle, and were stationed
near the town during the siege, which was terminated
by the surrender of the place on the 30th
of December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<div class="sidenote">1747</div>

<div class="sidenote">1748</div>

<p>The regiment continued to advance into Scotland,
and is mentioned in the list of the Duke of
Cumberland's army in the spring of 1746. On
the 14th of February it was detached to Dundee,
and after the suppression of the rebellion, returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to England, where it was employed in guarding
the rebel prisoners at York. The establishment
continued the same in this year, as it did in the
following, but after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
in 1748, the numbers were reduced to 285, the
regiment being then quartered at Bury St.
Edmunds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>A regulation was issued on the 1st July, 1751,
relative to the clothing and standards of the
several regiments; from which the following
particulars have been extracted relative to the
<span class="smcap">King's Own</span> dragoons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coats</span>&mdash;scarlet; double breasted; without lapels;
lined with light blue; slit sleeves turned

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1752</div>

<p>In 1752 Lieut.-General Bland was removed to
the King's dragoon guards, and His Majesty conferred
the colonelcy of <span class="smcap">His Own Dragoons</span> on
James Lord Tyrawley from the fourteenth dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1753</div>

<div class="sidenote">1754</div>

<p>In 1753 the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> lay at Colchester,
and in 1754 at Croydon. In December of this
year it was broken up into half troops, and employed
on coast duty: being scattered along the
sea coast, from Shoreham to the Isle of Wight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755</div>

<p>In April, 1755, Lord Tyrawley was removed to
the second foot guards, and King George II. conferred
the colonelcy of <span class="smcap">His Own Dragoons</span> on
<span class="smcap">George, Earl of Albemarle</span>, from the twentieth
foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756</div>

<p>In June, of the same year, the whole regiment
assembled at Lewes, where it remained till July,
1756. At this time the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>, in common
with the other regiments of dragoons, received the
addition, novel to the British service, of a <em>light
troop</em>. In July it marched to Reading, and in
December of the same year, to Northampton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1757</div>

<div class="sidenote">1758</div>

<p>The regiment marched to Henley, Amersham,
and High Wycombe in June, 1757; and war
having been declared against France in May,
1758, the light troop, then commanded by Captain
St. Leger, was ordered into camp on South Sea
Common, for the purpose of forming, with the
light troops of eight other regiments, part of the
force intended for a descent on the coast of France,
the whole forming a brigade, under Colonel Eliott,
afterwards Lord Heathfield. The troops embarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
May 19th, sailed June the 1st, and arrived on the
French coast so as to land in Cancalle Bay on the
5th. On the 7th the army moved on St. Maloes,
the light troops forming the advance guard, and
encamping about a mile from the town.</p>

<p>As soon as night fell, the piquets and light
dragoons were detached against the harbour and
the suburbs of St. Servan, being ordered, if possible,
to destroy the stores. This object they
effected with equal judgment and determination,
setting fire to the storehouses and vessels in the
harbour, together with the magazines of tar, pitch,
rope, &amp;c., so completely performing their work,
as totally to ruin the whole of the marine stores,
and to destroy one man-of-war of 50 guns, one of
36, and all the privateers, some of 30 guns each;
the vessels destroyed amounting to upwards of 100
sail, and the fire continuing to rage all night.
The light dragoons afterwards advanced to the
town of Dol, where, in several slight affairs, they
showed great zeal and activity. On the 11th,
they re-embarked, and the fleet sailed on the 16th,
remaining, however, some time longer on the
coast of France, and watching another opportunity
to land. This being rendered impracticable
by the weather, the fleet returned, and
arrived at Spithead on the first of July. The
light troops remained at Portsmouth for some
time, and many experiments were made with
boats of different constructions, in order to ascertain
the practicability of landing men and horses
in rough weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1759</div>

<p>In August the brigade of light dragoons proceeded
on a second expedition, and a landing
having been effected in the Bay des Marées,
<em>Cherbourg</em> was taken, and the fortifications, and
vessels in the harbour were destroyed. A descent
was afterwards effected in the Bay of St. Lunar,
and an incursion made into the adjacent country;
but on re-embarking, the rear guard was attacked,
and it sustained some loss. In December, the
light troops landed and went into quarters, the
light troop of the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> being quartered at
Maidenhead. So completely had these troops
answered the expectations entertained of them,
that, in the next year, the first English regiment of
light dragoons (the present fifteenth hussars) was
raised under Brigadier-General Eliott; and in June,
1759, each light troop received an augmentation
of one lieutenant, one serjeant, and twenty-nine
privates. On the 7th of November, the <span class="smcap">King's
Own</span> marched to Hounslow and Brentford, relieving
the royals, who proceeded to Essex.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760</div>

<div class="sidenote">1761</div>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>On the 21st of June, 1760<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, the regiment received
orders to prepare for embarkation for
Germany, to join the army of Prince Ferdinand.
These orders were, however, countermanded, and
in 1761 and 1762 the regiment was successively
quartered at Romford, Colchester, Uxbridge, and
Chelmsford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>Peace having been restored by the treaty of
Fontainbleau; in April, 1763, the light troop was
disbanded at Putney; but a few men of each
troop were afterwards equipped as light dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1764</div>

<p>In June the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> lay at York, and remained
there till the spring of 1764, when they
marched to Scotland, and occupied Dalkeith,
Leith, Haddington, Musselburgh, and Linlithgow;
and orders were received for remounting
with <em>long-tailed</em> horses.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1765</div>

<div class="sidenote">1766</div>

<p>In 1765, the regiment lay at Coventry and
Warwick, and in the next year passed the summer
at Reading, where it was reviewed on the 10th of
May, afterwards taking up winter quarters at
Dorchester, Blandford, and Sherbourne. At the
same time the drummers on the establishment
were ordered to be replaced by trumpeters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1767</div>

<div class="sidenote">1768</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> were employed on coast duty
in 1767 and 1768; in the first year in Kent and
Sussex, head quarters at Lewes; and the second
in Suffolk and Essex, head quarters at Ipswich.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1769</div>

<div class="sidenote">1770</div>

<p>Five troops lay at York and one at Hull in 1769,
and in the next year the regiment marched to
Scotland, head quarters, with three troops, being
stationed at Hamilton, and detachments at Linlithgow,
Irvine, and Kilmarnock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771</div>

<div class="sidenote">1772</div>

<p>In the year 1771, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> lay at
Preston, Blackburn, Wigan, and Warrington; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
in 1772 at Worcester, Pershore, and Bromsgrove.
In October of this year the colonelcy was conferred
on the Honourable Charles Fitzroy (afterwards
Lord Southampton)<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, from the fourteenth
dragoons, in succession to the Earl of Albemarle,
deceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1774</div>

<div class="sidenote">1775</div>

<div class="sidenote">1776</div>

<p>In June, 1773, we find the regiment employed
in aid of the revenue service on the coast of Kent,
with its head-quarters at Canterbury. The year
1774 was spent at Northampton, and in April,
1775, the regiment was again marched to Scotland,
being at East Retford in August, and in the
autumn taking up quarters at Haddington, Dalkeith,
and Musselburgh. In December of the same
year, one troop was detached as far as Wakefield,
and in the spring of 1776, the whole regiment
followed to the south, and was quartered at
Coventry, Lichfield, and Birmingham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1777</div>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>In 1777, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> were reviewed at
Newbury, and thence took up winter quarters at
Blandford, Dorchester and Sherbourne. Early
in 1778 they were ordered to Salisbury, there to
be reviewed, and thence proceeded to Suffolk, and
were encamped on Culford Heath, under the
command of Lieutenant-General Warde, finally
going into winter quarters in Sussex, and being
employed there on coast duty during the remainder
of the year. The regiment had, for many years,
been in possession of a pair of <span class="smcap">Kettle Drums</span>, in
consequence of having taken them from the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and on the 25th of December, 1778, an additional
man and horse was placed upon the establishment,
which gave the regiment its complement of Trumpeters
besides the kettle drummer; being granted
by His Majesty in compliance with a memorial
from the Colonel<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1779</div>

<p>In the spring of 1779, the men of the regiment
equipped as light dragoons, were incorporated,
with detachments from other corps, into a regiment,
which was numbered the twenty-first light
dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1780</div>

<p>In consequence of the alarming riots in London
in 1780, the regiment was ordered thither, and
was quartered about Islington, furnishing the
piquets in Portman Square during the trial of
Lord George Gordon, and having a party stationed
in Apsley House, then the property of Lord
Chancellor Bathurst.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1781</div>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<div class="sidenote">1783</div>

<p>In 1781, having been reviewed by His Majesty
in Hyde Park, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> marched into
Suffolk; and in 1782, were quartered at Derby,
Leicester, and Nottingham, thence proceeding to
Manchester in the autumn. In 1783, after the
spring review they marched to Newcastle-on-Tyne
and Durham, assembled at the latter place
for inspection in September, and then returned
to their old quarters for the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1784</div>

<div class="sidenote">1785</div>

<div class="sidenote">1786</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>, for the third time in fourteen
years, entered Scotland in 1784, and took up
their old quarters at Dalkeith, Leith, and Haddington.
Here they were inspected by Major-General
Mackay, and soon after detached a
troop to Dumfries. In July, 1785, the six troops
were at Manchester, and thence, in 1786, proceeded
to Worcester, then a general place of
inspection for cavalry. At this station they were
inspected by Major-General Philipson, and, after
a stay of about six weeks, went into winter quarters
at Hereford, Ludlow, and Leominster.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1787</div>

<div class="sidenote">1788</div>

<p>In May, 1787, the regiment assembled at Hereford
to be reviewed by Major-General Douglas. It
was ordered, on the rumour of a Russian armament,
to hold itself in readiness to join any force
that might be assembled; but, nothing taking
place, it went into winter quarters at Dorchester,
Blandford, and Poole. In 1788, it moved to
Salisbury, was there reviewed, and then quartered
at Winchester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1789</div>

<div class="sidenote">1790</div>

<p>Early in 1789, the regiment marched to Reading.
It was there reviewed by His Majesty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
George III., on Ashford Common, and marched
to Ipswich, where it remained until 1790, and,
being then reviewed at Stamford, took up winter
quarters at York and Lincoln.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1791</div>

<div class="sidenote">1792</div>

<p>At York all the troops assembled for inspection
in the spring of 1791, and, for the fourth time
marched to Scotland and were for two years
quartered at Dumfries, being in that period
twice inspected by Major-General Leslie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>In the spring of 1793, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> received
an order to augment three troops, and,
after a short halt at Manchester, proceeded to
Birmingham. From this place, four troops, under
the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Waller, were
detached back to Scotland, in consequence of
serious riots in that part of the kingdom. In 1794
the regiment was ordered to furnish one hundred
men, towards forming a regiment of cavalry for
service in the West Indies; the newly-formed
regiment was numbered the twenty-sixth light
dragoons, and afterwards, on a reduction of regiments
taking place, the twenty-third. In the
same year a squadron from the troops in England,
and one troop from those in Scotland, were ordered
to embark to join the troops on the continent.
The troop in Scotland marched a day or two,
and was then recalled in consequence of the disturbed
state of the country; and the squadron
embarked at Blackwall, and was actually at sea,
when it was recalled by a king's cutter, landed,
and sent to Watford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>In 1795, the troops returned from Scotland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
having had most harassing duty for two winters;
and in the spring of 1796, the whole regiment assembled
at Salisbury under Lord Cathcart, thence
proceeding to the camp at Weymouth, and finally
taking up winter quarters in Exeter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797</div>

<p>The colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">King's Own Dragoons</span>
was conferred in March 1797 on Major-General
Francis Lascelles from the eighth dragoons, in
succession to Lord Southampton, deceased.</p>

<p>During the summer, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> were
again encamped at Weymouth; and on the breaking
up of the camp, marched to Northampton,
where the ninth troop was reduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>In May, 1798, the regiment marched to Nottingham,
where an entire change took place in
the arms and clothing; the long skirt was
abolished, and instead of the musket and brace
of large pistols before used, the men received
the carbine and single pistol.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799</div>

<p>On the 10th of June, 1799, the regiment
marched to form part of the cavalry camp on
Swinley Downs, near Windsor, at which place
it received orders to join the armament under
Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, then about
to proceed to the Helder. These orders, however,
were countermanded; and, at the breaking up
of the camp, the regiment marched to Reading.
During the time of encampment, Lt.-Colonel
Callow<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> being appointed deputy governor of
Quebec, was succeeded by Lt.-Colonel Waller, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>on the 4th of September, General Sir Charles
Grey from the eighth dragoons succeeded General
Lascelles as colonel. At this period the tails of
the horses were again shortened, having been
worn of the natural length since 1764.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>In February, 1800, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> marched
to Trowbridge, but only remained there a few
weeks, and then proceeded to Chester to be
reviewed. At this place an augmentation of two
troops took place, making a total of ten; and
on the 22nd of September, the whole regiment
marched to Lancashire, thence to Carlisle, and,
in December, to Scotland, the head-quarters
being established at Hamilton; three troops, under
the command of Major Wade, being detached to
Carlisle and Penrith. At Hamilton, the regiment
was reviewed by Major-Generals Erskine
and Vyse, and the present system of casting
horses annually first introduced; and as it was
considered the peculiar privilege of the regiment
to have <em>black horses</em> exclusively, those that had
the slightest shade of brown, were sent to the
fourth dragoon guards, none but black horses
being retained, with the exception of one white
for the kettle-drums.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>After the peace of Amiens in 1802, two troops
were reduced; the number of men in the others
being also reduced from 100 to 64; and, on the
11th of August, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> embarked at
Port-Patrick for Ireland, proceeded to Dundalk,
and in the spring of 1803 marched to Belturbet.
Here they were reviewed by Major-General Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
James Afleck, and were actively employed in
patrolling the country during the excitement
caused by the disturbances in Dublin, to which
place they proceeded in March, 1804, and were
quartered in the royal barracks.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>On the 5th of April, 1805, the first division,
immediately followed by the others, embarked
for Liverpool, and marched to Nottingham, where
the regiment remained for two years; the second
year's halt being at the express request of the
magistrates of Nottingham and Louth. The war
having been resumed, two additional troops were
added to the establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>The regiment marched to Chichester in May
1807, and being there reviewed by Major-General
Hugonin, proceeded to Brighton, and was encamped
on the hills above the present barracks,
for the purpose of being reviewed, in conjunction
with the first dragoon guards, by His Royal
Highness the Duke of York. On the breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
up of the camp, the <span class="smcap">Third</span> marched to Chichester,
but were shortly ordered to Canterbury, where a
brigade was formed, consisting of the second
dragoon guards, and third and fourth dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>In January, 1809, the regiment received orders
to embark at Portsmouth, for the purpose of
joining the army in Spain, under Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore, and had advanced some days'
march, when it was recalled, on the arrival of the
news of the retreat of the British troops to Corunna.</p>

<p>On the 20th of July, the regiment received
orders to march to Ramsgate, and was immediately
embarked for Holland under the command
of Lieut.-Colonel Mundy, forming part of
an expedition designed to effect the destruction of
the French shipping and arsenal on the Scheldt.
After remaining in the Downs for six days, the
fleet sailed, and arrived off Walcheren on the 29th,
remaining there upwards of a fortnight; and
after the capture of Flushing, proceeded up the
Scheldt as far as Fort-Batz. The enemy's shipping
had, in the meantime, been removed higher
up the river, and an immense force assembled to
oppose the British armament; at the same time
an epidemic disease broke out among the English
soldiers. The fleet consequently retired down the
river, and sailed for England; the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>
disembarked at Ramsgate in September following,
and proceeded to occupy Canterbury, as before the
expedition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>In April, 1810, in consequence of the riots in
London, occasioned by the House of Commons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
having ordered Sir Francis Burdett to be lodged
in custody in the Tower, the regiment was hastily
ordered thither, marching all night, and arriving
in Southwark at 7 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> The men were billeted
on the south side of the Thames; an hotel near
Westminster Bridge being the head quarters, and
the Obelisk the alarm post. After the suppression
of the riots, the regiment was ordered to Guildford,
where it was reviewed by his Royal Highness the
Duke of Cambridge, who was pleased to express
his entire approbation of its appearance and discipline.
On the release of Sir Francis Burdett
from the Tower, the regiment was again sent to
London, but remained there a few nights only,
and then returned to Guildford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France,
having conquered Portugal, had placed his
brother Joseph on the throne of Spain, supported
by a French army. The efforts of the Spaniards
and Portuguese to regain their liberty, which
commenced in 1808, were continued to be aided
by the British government, and a force, amounting
at this time to nearly sixty thousand men, had
been assembled in Portugal under the command
of Lieutenant-General the Viscount Wellington.</p>

<p>In June, 1811, the <span class="smcap">King's Own Dragoons</span>,
having been reviewed on Wimbledon Common
by His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, were,
on their return to Guildford, completed to the field
establishment by a draft of a hundred horses<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>the second dragoon guards, and ordered forthwith
to proceed to the Peninsula. On the 25th and 27th
of July the regiment embarked at Portsmouth,
landed in the following month at Lisbon, under
the command of Lieut.-Colonel Mundy, and
having met with favourable weather during the
voyage, the Lieutenant-Colonel commanding was
enabled to cause particular attention to be paid to
the horses in regard to cleanliness, exercise, &amp;c.
The mode adopted for this purpose was as follows:
three or four horses were backed into the hold,
where they were walked round for a quarter of
an hour; their feet washed, and hand-rubbed;
and they were shod, if necessary; by these means
their state of health and efficiency, on their disembarkation
at Lisbon, were such, that upon
landing they were capable of undertaking immediate
service.</p>

<p>The regiment was reviewed at Belem by Major-General
Le Marchant, and mustered as follows:&mdash;1
Lieutenant-Colonel, 1 Major, 6 Captains,
9 Lieutenants, 1 Cornet, 1 Surgeon, 1 Assistant
Surgeon, 5 Troop Quarter-Masters, 1 Regimental
Serjeant-Major, 1 Paymaster Serjeant, 1 Troop
Serjeant-Major, 24 Serjeants, 24 Corporals, 6
Trumpeters, 6 Farriers, 480 Privates, and 518
Troop Horses.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> left Belem on the 19th of
September, under the command of Major Clowes,
(the Lieutenant Colonel having been compelled
by sickness to remain at Lisbon,) and marching
through Villa Franca and Santarem, arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Abrantes in Portuguese Estremadura on the 27th.
Here they remained until the 15th October, and
then advanced through Niza and Villa Velha to
Castello Branco in the province of Beira, where
they were reviewed on the 7th of December, by
Lieutenant-General Sir Stapleton Cotton, who expressed
his satisfaction at the very effective state
of the men and horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>In consequence of the extreme difficulty of procuring
forage, the centre squadron moved, on the
21st of December, to Idanha a Nova on the frontiers
of Spain, and in these quarters the regiment remained
till the beginning of 1812, when it was
ordered to the front to form part of the army
covering the siege of <em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em>, being quartered
at Aldea de Ponte and Fundao, and experiencing
great inconvenience from the scarcity of
forage.</p>

<p>In February, Lord Wellington having resolved
on the siege of Badajoz, the capital of Spanish
Estremadura, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> marched south
with their brigade (the fifth dragoon guards, and
fourth dragoons,) and arrived at Borba in the
Alemtejo on the 5th of March. On the 16th, a
pontoon bridge was thrown over the Guadiana, and
Badajoz was invested; the day previous to which
the brigade moved from Borba, and crossing the
bridge, formed the advance guard of the covering
army, which continued to advance till it arrived
at the foot of an extensive chain of mountains
called the Sierra Morena. On the 26th, the <span class="smcap">King's
Own</span> marched at sunset from Medina to Campo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and at midnight joined a force under Lieut.-General
Sir Thomas Graham, destined to surprise
three battalions of French infantry and two regiments
of cavalry lying in Llerena. Owing to a
mistake on the part of the Chasseurs Britanniques
(who formed the advance of the infantry column),
the projected surprise failed, and the French retired
into the mountains during the night, and
took post at Azuaga, a town nine miles to the south
of Llerena. On the 29th of March, after a sharp
affair, the French were driven from Azuaga, and
the head quarters of the <span class="smcap">Brigade</span> were established
there. The authorities of this town gave a superb
entertainment to Sir Stapleton Cotton.</p>

<p>On the night of the 31st of March, a man deserted,
who, it is supposed, gave information of
the situation and strength of the British outpost;
and on the 1st of April, a strong French force was
detached to cut off the piquets at La Granja. A
patrol, commanded by Cornet Ratcliffe of the
<span class="smcap">Third</span>, having met with the enemy's advance
guard, was driven in, and the two British squadrons
were attacked by seven squadrons of French
cavalry, supported by infantry. After a severe
struggle, the enemy, perceiving their surprise
had failed, retired, and the piquets resumed their
station.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In this affair the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> lost thirteen
men and twelve horses.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of April, Marshal Soult's army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
having advanced from Seville, with a view to raise
the siege of Badajoz, the covering army began to
retire before the superior numbers of the French.
This retreat was continued through Usagre, Villa
Franca, and Almandralejo, upon Albuhera, where,
being supported by the besieging force, the army
went into position on the 9th, and preparations
were made for a general action. Soult, however,
having heard of the fall of Badajoz, commenced a
retrograde movement towards the frontiers of
Andalusia on the 10th; on which day Major
General Le Marchant's brigade, (the fifth dragoon
guards, <span class="smcap">Third</span> and fourth dragoons) forming the
advance of the British, proceeded to Los Santos,
and again in the night to Bienvenida, with the
view of gaining the flank of the cavalry of a
French corps (General Drouet's) encamped between
Usagre and Villa Garcia; but the enemy retreated.
The <span class="smcap">Brigade</span>, however, defiled under cover of
some heights, and by a flank movement came up
with the French on the 11th in front of <em>Llerena</em>,
charging and driving them into that town with
the loss of one hundred and fifty prisoners, including
several officers.</p>

<p>Intelligence was received of the advance of Marshal
Marmont, on the north of Portugal. This
general, leaving Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, on
his rear, had pushed on as far as Castello Branco,
thus threatening to destroy the communications of
the British, by cutting the bridge of boats at
Villa Velha. It therefore became necessary to
reinforce the few troops left on that frontier, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Major General Le Marchant's brigade was one of
those ordered for this service. It marched through
Elvas, Estremos, Crato, Niza, and Villa Velha to
Castello Branco, and finally took up its quarters at
Val-de-rosa; but Marmont having retired into
Spain on the approach of the British, the brigade
returned to the Alemtejo, and was, on the 12th of
April, stationed at Cabeca de Vide, Crato, and
Fronteira, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> being at the former
place. On the 29th they received a sudden order
to join a brigade of light cavalry, for the purpose
of covering Lieut.-General Hill in his attack
upon the tête-de-pont and bridge of boats at
Almaraz, which brilliant exploit having been
effected, the regiment returned to Cabeca de Vide
on the 27th of May.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June the whole army, with the
exception of Lieut.-General Hill's corps, moved
to the north. On the 11th, Major-General Le
Marchant's brigade arrived at <em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em>,
and on the 12th was reviewed by Lord Wellington.
On the 13th, the brigade moved forward
and continued to advance till the 16th, when it
found the enemy posted near <em>Salamanca</em>, and a
skirmish took place which lasted till night-fall.
On the 17th, the brigade crossed the Tormes, and
was quartered near the village of Cabrerizos, and
on the advance of the French, on the 20th, the
whole army went into position on the heights
of St. Christoval, with its right on the Tormes,
and its left near Villares de la Reyna. On this
day the brigade, being in front, sustained a can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>nonade
of about an hour, and the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>
lost twenty horses: the regiment afterwards took
post on the summit of the mountain.</p>

<p>On the night of the 23rd the French army
retired, and was followed at daybreak by the
first and seventh divisions, and Le Marchant's
brigade of cavalry, which crossed the river by the
fords of Santa Marta; when Marshal Marmont,
after a short delay, returned to his former position,
and manœuvred for some days on the Tormes,
but after the reduction of the forts at Salamanca,
which took place on the 27th, he crossed the
Douro at Tordesillas, closely followed by Lord
Wellington, who, however, did not cross the river,
but took up a position between Pollos and La
Seca; Major-General Le Marchant's brigade being
stationed at Pollos and Naval del Rey to watch
the ford.</p>

<p>Marshal Marmont being strengthened by a
division from the Asturias, pushed a column
across the river on the 16th of July, in consequence
of which the troops in Pollos fell back
upon Fuente la Pena. On the 18th, it was
understood that the enemy's army had passed
the Douro at Tordesillas, by which manœuvre
the safety of two divisions, and a brigade of
cavalry, on the Trebancos, was much endangered,
and Major-General Le Marchant's, with two other
brigades of cavalry, were quickly moved up to
cover their retreat, which was effected with trifling
loss. The brigade had entered its bivouac
near Canizal, when an order was received for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
squadron of the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> to proceed to the
support of two guns, intended to be placed on
the hill above Castrillos. This order was soon
increased to the whole regiment, which, on its
march, discovered that the enemy was advancing
in force, and pressing Major-General Alten's
brigade very closely. Major Clowes immediately
solicited, and received permission to go to
their support, and the regiment accordingly advanced,
and though checked by the fire of some
French infantry, assisted in driving back the
enemy's cavalry; the French infantry continuing
to advance were repulsed by Lieut.-General
Cole's division, and pursued with great loss. In
this affair the regiment sustained the following
loss; one serjeant-major, six privates, and four
horses killed; lieutenant Branfell, and two privates
wounded.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>On the 19th, the <span class="smcap">Brigade</span> retired to the table
land above the villages of Vallesa and El Olmo,
and on the 20th, the hostile armies manœuvred
within cannon shot of each other, the French
moving to their left, and the British to their
right. On the 21st the British went into their
old position on the heights of St. Christoval,
and the French crossed the Tormes at the fords
of Alba and Huerta, marching to their left. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
oppose this manœuvre, the British crossed the
river at <em>Salamanca</em>. In the course of this day's
manœuvres, Major-General Le Marchant's brigade
crossed the river at the ford of Santa Marta
three times, and took up its bivouac on the south
bank opposite the town. In the course of this
night so dreadful a thunder-storm burst upon
the British lines, that the horses broke loose;
many were lost by running into the French lines,
and the remainder could not be secured till daybreak.
The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> had to send to the rear
an officer and sixteen men, severely injured by
the horses, which were all linked together, running
over them.</p>

<p>The morning of the 22nd of July, found the
hostile armies opposed to each other. The British
line was formed with its left on the Tormes,
and its right on the rocky hills called the
Arapiles; Major-General Le Marchant's brigade,
quitting its bivouac ground, formed line in the
centre of the position, to check the advance of
the enemy's cavalry. The French marshal manœuvred
to gain the road to Ciudad Rodrigo;
his dragoons, after some skirmishing, were compelled
to retire, and the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> again took
ground to their right, passing the village of
Arapiles, and forming in support of the fourth
and fifth divisions. Lord Wellington, taking
advantage of an injudicious movement made by
his opponent, ordered his divisions forward, and
the battle commenced. The French, attacked
while making a complicated evolution, were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>stantly
broken. A favourable opportunity for a
charge of the British heavy cavalry occurring,
the fifth dragoon guards, <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>, and fourth
dragoons, advanced, and a most animated scene
presented itself. The din of conflict was heard on
every side; clouds of dust and rising columns of
smoke darkened the air, and enveloped the British
squadrons as they rushed to battle. In front,
the glittering bayonets and waving plumes of the
French infantry were dimly seen through the
thickened atmosphere; against these formidable
ranks, the English horsemen dashed with terrific
violence, the weight and fury of their charge
broke the opposing lines, and in an instant the
French musketeers were overthrown and trampled
down with a terrible clamour and disturbance.
'Bewildered and blinded, they cast away their
arms and ran through the openings of the British
squadrons, stooping and demanding quarter,
while the dragoons, big men, and on big horses,
rode onward, smiting with their long glittering
swords in uncontrollable power, and the third
division followed at speed, shouting as the French
masses fell in succession before this dreadful
charge.'</p>

<p>'Nor were these valiant swordsmen yet exhausted.
Their own general, Le Marchant,
and many officers had fallen, but Cotton and
all his staff were at their head, and with ranks
confused, and blended together in one mass,
still galloping forward they sustained from a
fresh column an irregular stream of fire which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
emptied a hundred saddles; yet with fine courage,
and downright force, the survivors broke
through this the third and strongest body of men
that had encountered them, and Lord Edward Somerset,
continuing his course at the head of one
squadron, with a happy perseverance, captured
five guns. The French left was entirely broken,
more than two thousand prisoners were taken,
the French light horsemen abandoned that part
of the field, and Thomiere's division no longer
existed as a military body. Anson's cavalry,
which had passed quite over the hill, and had
suffered little in the charge, was now joined by
D'Urban's troopers, and took the place of Le
Marchant's exhausted men; the heavy German
dragoons followed in reserve, and with the third
and fifth divisions and the guns formed one
formidable line two miles in advance of where
Pakenham first attacked, and that impetuous
officer, with unmitigated strength, still pressed
forward, spreading terror and disorder on the
enemy's left<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.'</p>

<p>In this attack Major-General Le Marchant
received a ball through the body, which terminated
the career of that brave and talented officer.
Lieutenant Selby, of the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>, was likewise
killed by a musket-shot through the left
breast.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The result of this day was the entire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>overthrow of the French, 7,000 prisoners, eleven
guns and two eagles remaining in the hands of
the victors. The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> earned, on this
occasion, the royal permission to bear the word
'<span class="smcap">Salamanca</span>,' on their guidons. They sustained
the following loss: Killed,&mdash;Lieutenant Selby,
one serjeant, nine privates, and two officers'
horses, and 13 troop horses. Wounded,&mdash;one
serjeant, eight privates, and fifteen horses.</p>

<p>After the action the French retreated upon
Alba, where they crossed the Tormes, and thence
through Arevalo, upon Valladolid, sustaining in
their march a severe loss from the German cavalry,
which, having been uninjured in the battle,
was despatched in pursuit of, and overtook their
rear-guard three leagues beyond Alba, defeating
it, and taking nine hundred prisoners.</p>

<p>The British army advanced on the route of
the French, and entered Valladolid on the 30th
of July; on the following day Cuellar was occupied,
and on the 6th of August, the army moved
on Segovia, crossed the Guadarama mountains
on the 10th, and entered Madrid on the 12th;
the brigade, now commanded by Colonel Ponsonby,
forming the personal escort of Lord Wellington.</p>

<p>After halting seven days at Madrid, the brigade
moved to St. Ildefonso, where it was cantoned
for a few days. Intelligence was received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>that the army of General Clausel, who had succeeded
Marmont, was advancing on Valladolid,
and the British in consequence assembled at
Olivares and its vicinity. An immediate attack
was intended; but the artillery of the fifth division
not arriving in time, the enemy retired on the 7th
of September, having destroyed the bridge at
Valladolid. They continued retreating rapidly
till the 17th, when the immediate vicinity of
Burgos induced Clausel to make a stand, and
Colonel Ponsonby's brigade was ordered to the
front; but, before the army could be formed for
attack, the enemy again retired to Breviesca,
leaving a strong garrison in the castle of Burgos.</p>

<p>The castle was invested, and the covering army
took up a position on the heights of Quintana
Palla, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> being at Villa Yerna.</p>

<p>On the 19th of October, the French General
Souham, who now commanded in the place of
Clausel, being greatly reinforced, resolved to attempt
the relief of Burgos. About four <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> the
French attacked and carried the village of Quintanapalla,
but were repulsed in every attempt to
penetrate farther, and abandoned the village on
the approach of a force destined to retake it, consisting
of the left wing of infantry, and Ponsonby's
brigade of cavalry.</p>

<p>It being ascertained that Marshal Soult and
Joseph Bonaparte were moving on the Tagus,
and that Sir Rowland Hill, menaced by such
powerful forces, could not maintain his position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
on that river, at the same time his retreat would
leave the army before Burgos, already in a critical
situation, quite insulated, the Marquis of Wellington
resolved to retire so far as was necessary to
form a junction with Sir Rowland Hill; and at
dusk on the 21st, the army withdrew with such
celerity and silence that the French were not
aware of the retreat till the British had reached
Hormillas, and did not show in any force till the
evening of the 22nd of October. On the next
morning the retrograde movement was continued
in two columns, Ponsonby's brigade covering the
column from Hormillas, and being threatened
during the day by an immense body of cavalry.
Such was the steadiness of the troops, that the
overwhelming, force of the French could make
no impression and the column went into bivouac
for the night on the hills above Cordovilla, with
little or no loss.</p>

<p>An hour before daylight on the 24th, the
column, covered by Ponsonby's brigade, filed
over the bridge of Cordovilla, and in the course
of the day, the army crossed the Carrion, the
head-quarters being established at Duenas. Early
on the morning of the 25th, two squadrons of the
fifth dragoon guards and <span class="smcap">Third</span> dragoons were
sent to the bridges of Palencia, to cover the party
employed in mining them for destruction, but
the French, advancing in force, gained possession
of the bridges in an unbroken state. At this
place the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> lost a man and horse by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
a round shot, and the party returned in the evening
to Duenas; the army having in the meantime
destroyed the bridges at that place, and at Villa
Muriel, and the enemy having been defeated in
an attempt to cross by the fords.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>The army retired four leagues on the 26th of
October, and crossed the Pisuerga at Cabezon, in
which town, and its vicinity, it remained till the
29th, when it retired early, and crossed the Douro
at Tudela and Puente del Douro, the bridges at
which places were blown up, as were those at
Toro and Zamora; but the French having possessed
themselves of the bridge at Tordesillas, the British
on the following morning took up a position in
front of it. In this position they remained till
the 6th of November, when, the enemy having
repaired the bridge of Toro, it became necessary
to retire to Torrecilla de la Orden, and thence, on
the 7th and 8th, to Salamanca. On the 14th,
the French crossed the Tormes, and the British
recommenced their retreat on the following
morning, and entered Ciudad Rodrigo on the
18th; they afterwards went into winter quarters
on the frontiers of Portugal, the enemy not advancing
beyond the Yeltes. On the 20th, Ponsonby's
brigade was at Albergaria, where it halted
eight days, after which the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> proceeded
by the route of Guarda, Celerico, and Penhancos,
to Saixho. Here the regiment was quartered
until the 28th of December, then at Arganil till
February 11th, 1813, and afterwards at Soure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
near the mouth of the Mondego, until the 19th
of April.</p>

<p>On the above day the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> moved
towards the north of Portugal, and rejoined the
brigade at Braganza, on the 21st of May. On the
24th the brigade was at Tabara, and on the 26th
it crossed the Esla at Pozuela. The enemy made
no resistance at the passage of the river, and was
compelled to abandon the line of the Douro, by
Lord Wellington's advance along their rear. The
column to which Ponsonby's brigade was attached,
was directed on Valencia, and passing through
that town, advanced on Burgos. On the 12th of
June, the brigade overtook the enemy's rear-guard
on the heights of Estepar, when the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>
were detached to cut off part of the enemy's force,
in which the regiment completely succeeded,
making its way to the high road from Madrid,
throwing the enemy into confusion on Burgos;
a squadron of the fourteenth, with a detachment
of the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>, charging the enemy's
rear, captured a gun: the regiment had captain
Sitwell and one private wounded, and five horses
killed and three wounded.</p>

<p>During the night of the 12th, the French blew
up the castle of Burgos and retired behind the
Ebro, which river the brigade, after marching
through a wild and difficult region of deep narrow
valleys and rugged defiles, crossed at Puente de
Arenas on the 15th. Both armies were concentrated,
the British on the river Bayas, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
French on the undulating grounds in the valley
of <em>Vittoria</em>, where, on the 21st of June, they were
attacked by the allied army. The result of this
attack was a most decisive victory, the French only
carrying from the field two guns; the whole of
their immense equipment fell into the hands
of the British. Owing to the nature of the field
of battle the cavalry could scarcely act,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and that
<em>arme</em> was principally employed in supporting the
infantry, and in the pursuit, which was continued
until the enemy had passed Pampeluna. The
gallant bearing of the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> was rewarded
in 1821, with the royal permission to bear the
word "<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>" on their guidons.</p>

<p>At this period, General Clausel with fifteen
thousand men was at Logroño, and of course, was
not engaged in the battle; nor was he aware that
an engagement had taken place, till he arrived
near Vittoria, and found the town in the possession
of the British: he then returned to
Logroño, and marched upon Tudela, hoping to
reach Pampeluna before the British. On the 27th
his scheme was discovered, and the Marquis of
Wellington detached the cavalry with two divisions
of infantry to intercept him. This detached force
arrived on the same night at Tafalla and Olieta,
and on the next morning advanced upon Tudela,
when it was discovered that Clausel, upon receiving
intelligence of the force sent against him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
had retreated to Saragossa, whence he returned
to France by the pass of Jaca, his artillery falling
into the hands of the Spanish troops.</p>

<p>On the 30th of June the infantry returned to
Pampeluna, and Major-General Ponsonby's brigade
remained at Tafalla for eleven days, when
forage becoming scarce, it moved to Laraga, and
halted there a fortnight.</p>

<p>The cavalry received an order to move to the
north on the 27th of July, in consequence of the
troops having been forced from the passes of
Roncesvalles and Maya in the Pyrenees. The
army took up a position at Huarte and Villarba,
and the town of Pampeluna was illuminated at
the prospect of relief. On the 28th, Soult attacked
the British position, but was repulsed with
loss; Count D'Erlon's division was compelled to
fall back upon Maya, and the British recovered
their lost ground. On the 8th of August, the
<span class="smcap">King's Own</span> fell back upon Allo and Dicastello,
and on the 27th of December, removed for the
convenience of forage to the neighbourhood of
Vittoria, occupying the villages of Alegria,
Aranjuez, and Troconiz, and remained there until
the 24th of February following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>An advance took place, Ponsonby's brigade
marched through the Pyrenean mountains by
Salinas Bergara, Villa Franca and Tolosa, to St.
Jean de Luz in France, halted there two days, and
then advanced through Bidart to the Adour,
crossing the river on a bridge of boats, and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>tinued
to follow the route of the French, who
were retreating on Bayonne. The advance was
continued through Peyrehorade to Castlenau,
and on the 19th of March, 1814, Marshal Soult
was discovered in position, with his left at <em>Tarbes</em>,
and his right at Rabastens. This right flank was
ordered to be turned by a division of infantry,
and Ponsonby's brigade of cavalry, and being
thus threatened, Soult retired through a strong
country by St. Gaudens, upon Toulouse. The
British, being obliged to wait for stores, did
not advance rapidly, and on the 25th, the <span class="smcap">King's
Own</span> lay at Fontenelle. On the next day the
regiment advanced to <em>La Mosquiere</em>, and there
came up with a regiment of French <i lang="fr">Chasseurs
à cheval</i>, which it charged and drove beyond
Cuneva, taking several prisoners and horses, and
seizing a large quantity of bread prepared by the
French for their own use. Lieut. Burns' horse
was killed, Lieut. Jebb's wounded, and two troop
horses killed, but the regiment sustained no further
loss.</p>

<p>The army arrived before <em>Toulouse</em> on the 27th
of March, and on the 31st, a pontoon bridge being
laid at St. Roques, the brigade crossed the
Garonne, and seized the bridge on the Arriege,
at Cintagabelle. The roads were found so bad
in this direction that no further attempt was
made, and the troops being recalled, the pontoon
bridge was removed to Grenade, a town below
Bayonne, and there laid down on the 4th of
April. On this day Ponsonby's, with two other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
brigades of cavalry, and three divisions of infantry,
crossed the river, the brigade being quartered
at Grissolles, and having a strong piquet on the
road to Montauban. In the course of the night
the river rose so considerably, that the bridge
was obliged to be removed, and the communication
was cut off; Soult, however, made no attack,
but employed himself in strengthening his
position, which covered Toulouse.</p>

<p>On the 8th of April the current subsided, and
the pontoons were again laid down. On the
9th the troops were passing the river, and on
Easter Sunday (the 10th), Soult was attacked
in his position. In this attack the brigade, then
commanded by Colonel Lord Charles Manners,
was at different periods employed in supporting
the Spanish forces, the hussar brigade, and General
Clinton's division. It was not a cavalry action,
and the only casualties were&mdash;Captain Burn, one
trumpeter, four privates, wounded: two horses
killed. The enemy abandoned his entrenchments
before dusk, and took post behind the canal.
The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> were rewarded for their conduct
on this occasion with the royal permission,
dated 20th September, 1821, to bear the word
"<span class="smcap">Toulouse</span>" on their guidons.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult retired down the canal on the
12th towards Carcasonne, and on the 13th, hostilities
were terminated by the arrival of the news
of the abdication of Napoleon, and of the accession
of Louis XVIII. to the throne of France; Marshals
Soult and Suchet, after a short delay, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
their assent to the new order of affairs, and a line
of demarcation between the armies was agreed
upon. The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> went into quarters at
Lanta and Caraman, and remained there until
the end of May.</p>

<p>On the 10th of June, the brigade, having embarked
its dismounted men at Bourdeaux, commenced
its march to the north by the following
route:&mdash;</p>

<p>At Boulogne Major-General Sir Henry Fane
inspected the three regiments, and expressed his
satisfaction at the efficiency of the brigade after
so long a march. He congratulated the commanding
officers on the excellent condition of their
horses, and selected a number, of which the
<span class="smcap">King's Own</span> furnished fifteen, to be given up to
the French government for the purpose of mounting
the royal guard. On the 19th of July, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
brigade, having received the highest praise from
Major-General the Hon. W. Ponsonby,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> embarked
at Boulogne and arrived at Dover on the
following day, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> having been
absent three years, from the time of their embarkation
on the 25th of the same month, 1811.</p>

<p>From Dover the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> marched through
Maidstone to Brentford, and, on the 28th of July,
were reviewed on Hounslow Heath by His Royal
Highness the Commander-in-Chief, immediately
afterwards commencing their march to Northampton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>and joining the depôt (which had
marched thither from Canterbury) on the 3rd of
August. On the 13th two troops were reduced,
and on the 16th, the regiment marched for Newcastle-on-Tyne,
arriving there on the 1st of September;
two troops were detached to Carlisle,
and one to Durham.</p>

<p>On the 26th of September, the head-quarters
marched into York barracks,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> troops being left
at Newcastle, Morpeth, Carlisle, and Workington.
In these quarters the Regiment was reviewed by
Lieutenant-General Wynyard in the summer of
1815, and afterwards marched for St. Albans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>In the meantime Napoleon Bonaparte had returned
to France; a British army had assembled in
Belgium under the command of the Duke of Wellington;
the battle of Waterloo had been won, and
the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> were ordered to form ten troops,
four of which marched to Coventry, and the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
six, consisting of thirty-two officers, thirty-four
serjeants, six trumpeters, three hundred and
seventy-one rank and file, and three hundred and
eighty-two horses, proceeded to Dover and Ramsgate,
where they immediately embarked for
Ostend to reinforce the British army in France.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> disembarked at Ostend on
the 24th of July, and moving up the country into
France, were, on their arrival in the vicinity of
Paris, placed in cantonments at Chaton, near
Malmaison. On the 2nd of September, the Emperor
of Russia reviewed the first and eighth brigades
of cavalry, consisting of the first and second
life guards, royal horse guards, first, second, and
third dragoon guards, and <span class="smcap">Third</span> dragoons. On
the 22nd of the same month, the allied army was
reviewed by the Duke of Wellington on the plain
of St. Denis, and on the 11th of October, the whole
of the British, Hanoverian, Danish, and Saxon
contingents, were reviewed between Paris and St.
Denis, by the Duke of Wellington, the Emperor
of Russia, and the King of Prussia; after the
review the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> marched to Nantes, where
they remained several months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>On the 25th of January, 1816, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>
forming part of the Army of Occupation left in
France after the restoration of Louis XVIII. left
Nantes, and after successively making short halts
at Bonnieres, Ligny, and Bailleul, took up quarters
at Steenvoorde, on the 1st of June. Here the
regiment remained till the 1st of August, and
then marched to Theronenne, where it was twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
reviewed; on the 12th of October by the Duke
of Wellington, and on the 22nd by His Royal
Highness the Duke of Kent, and the Duke of
Wellington. At this last review the whole of the
British army was assembled on the plains of
Denain. After the review the regiment marched
to Audricq, and remained there all the following
year; occasionally, however, moving to different
towns, as Bouberg, Louches, and the vicinity of
St. Omer, for the purpose of reviews and inspections,
or to make room for troops marching to the
coast for embarkation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>In the year 1818 the reviews went on in the
same way and on the same ground, until October
18th, on which day the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>, being
ordered to return to England, embarked at Calais
for Dover, landed there on the following day, and
marched to Canterbury. On the 24th, a considerable
reduction took place in the regiment, two
troops being disbanded, and the remaining eight
ordered to consist of one serjeant-major, two
serjeants, three corporals, one trumpeter, one farrier,
forty-two privates, and thirty-four horses each.</p>

<p>In October, 1818, His Royal Highness the
Prince Regent, in the name and on the behalf of
His Majesty, was pleased to direct, that the <span class="smcap">Third</span>
and <span class="smcap">Fourth</span> Regiments of <em>Dragoons</em> should be
mounted, clothed, and equipped as <em>Light Dragoon</em>
Regiments; the alteration of title, &amp;c., to
take effect from the 25th December, 1818.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>On the 26th October, two squadrons, under the
command of Major Davenport, marched to Salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Hill, to attend the funeral of Her Majesty Queen
Charlotte, and on the 7th of December, the remaining
troops marched for Bristol, on their route
to Ireland, disembarked at Waterford, and detaching
one squadron to Tullamore, marched into
Newbridge barracks on the 7th of February, 1819.
In these stations the regiment was reviewed by
Lieutenant-General Sir Edward Paget, who was
pleased to express his approbation of its appearance
and discipline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820</div>

<p>In January, 1820, in consequence of the disturbed
state of the province of Connaught, two
squadrons of the regiment were hastily ordered
to march thither; one troop was quartered at
Ballinasloe, one at Tuam, and the other two at
Ballinrobe. In March, Generals Sir Edward
Paget and Sir John Elley arrived with all the
disposable force, and from their exertions the
country assumed some appearance of tranquillity.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> returned to Newbridge, and
was there, on the 22nd of May, inspected by Major-General
Sir Colquhoun Grant, who was pleased to
give them the highest praise.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> marched
to Dublin, and on the next day was reviewed, for
the first time, as a "<span class="smcap">Light Regiment</span>;" other
reviews took place on the 21st and 30th, before
Lieut.-General Sir David Baird, and the regiment
returned to Newbridge.</p>

<p>On the 16th of August, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>
marched into Dublin, relieving the royal dragoons,
who sailed for England, and in October, the regi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>ment
was inspected by Major-General Sir Colquhoun
Grant, who issued the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">'October 14th, 1820.</p>

<p>'The half-yearly inspection of the <span class="smcap">King's Own
Light Dragoons</span> affords Major-General Sir C.
Grant an opportunity of again expressing his approbation
of that corps. The interior arrangements,
field movements, attention of the officers,
and steadiness of the men, all enable him to
make the most satisfactory report to the Commander
of the Forces.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>The regiment remained in Dublin during the
winter, and in January, 1821, the colonelcy was
conferred on Lieut.-General Stapleton Cotton,
Viscount Combermere, K.C.B., G.C.H., in succession
to General Cartwright, who was removed to
the first dragoon guards.</p>

<p>On the 17th of August the regiment had the
honour of forming the personal escort of His
Majesty King George the Fourth, on his public
entry into Dublin. On the 18th, His Majesty
reviewed the garrison, then consisting of the
<span class="smcap">Third</span> and sixth dragoons, seventh hussars, twelfth
and nineteenth lancers, of the twenty-third, thirty-third,
forty-third, fifty-second, and seventy-eighth
regiments of infantry. The King remained in
Dublin until the 2nd of September, on which day,
having been escorted to Powerscourt by a detachment
of <span class="smcap">His Own</span> regiment of dragoons, His
Majesty embarked at Dunleary, the remainder
of the regiment forming a guard of honour at the
harbour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 4th and 5th of September, the <span class="smcap">King's
Own</span> marched out of Dublin, and took up quarters
in the counties of Waterford and Wexford, at
Cahir, New Ross, and Fethard.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Here, however,
they remained only a short time, being ordered to
Newcastle and Limerick, in consequence of the
disturbances which agitated that part of Ireland,
particularly the county of Limerick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822</div>

<p>In these quarters the regiment was inspected on
the 22nd of October, by Major General Sir John
Elley, and in January, 1822, the head-quarters
marched to Limerick, troops and detachments
being stationed at nine different places in the
south of Ireland. The regiment was, in June,
again inspected by Sir John Elley, and being
ordered to embark for England, had the honour of
receiving an order from Major-General Sir John
Lambert, commanding the district, in which the
major-general was pleased to state that 'he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
not allow the regiment to leave the district without
expressing his entire satisfaction at the manner
in which most harassing duties had been performed
by the head-quarters and detachments in
the disturbed part of the country.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>On the 19th and 22nd of June, the regiment
embarked at Waterford, and landing at Bristol,
proceeded to Brighton, and on the 28th of October,
having marched to Chichester, was reviewed by
Major-General Lord Edward Somerset, one troop
being detached to Hastings. On the 7th of November,
the regiment marched to Romford, where
it remained till June, 1828, and hence proceeded
to Hampton Court and its vicinity. Here, on
the 15th of July, a grand cavalry review took
place. The brigades were a cuirassier brigade,
first and second life guards, and royal horse
guards, commanded by Colonel Sir Robert Hill;
a light brigade, <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> light dragoons,
seventh and fifteenth hussars, commanded by
Colonel Lord Charles Manners; and a brigade
of horse artillery, commanded by Colonel Sir
Augustus Frazer. These troops, being commanded
by Major-General Lord E. Somerset,
were reviewed by His Royal Highness the Duke
of York, Commander-in-Chief, and on the 22nd,
an order was issued highly flattering to the whole
of the regiments present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> remained at Hounslow for
some months, in the course of which, on leaving
the station of Hampton Court, the troops received
a most honourable testimonial of their character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and conduct from His Royal Highness the Duke
of Clarence.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>On the 7th of July, 1824, the same brigades
under the same officers, were again reviewed by
His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief,
and on the 12th the head-quarters of the <span class="smcap">King's
Own</span> marched for Coventry, troops being detached
to Birmingham, Hinckley, and Abergavenny.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825</div>

<p>In May, 1825, the regiment having been inspected
by Major-General Lord Edward Somerset,
the head-quarters moved to Newcastle-on-Tyne, a
squadron being detached to Carlisle. On the
22nd of July, a party was detached to Sunderland,
in consequence of the riots there, in which the
associated keelmen had gained such power as to
prevent any vessels putting to sea. On the 3rd
of August, these disturbances grew to such a
height that it became necessary for the military,
under the direction of the magistrates, to make use
of their arms, when seven lives were unfortunately
lost; but of so good effect was this salutary severity,
that from that time order was restored, and the
troops returned to Newcastle, receiving from
Major-General Harris, commanding the district,
from the Horse-guards, and from the magistrates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and inhabitants of Sunderland, the highest praise
for their coolness and forbearance, under very
trying circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>On the 27th of May, 1825, Colonel Lord Charles
S. Manners was promoted to the rank of Major-General,
and was succeeded in the Lieutenant-colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Third, King's Own, Light Dragoons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></span>
by Colonel Lord Robert Manners, from the
half-pay of the Tenth Royal Hussars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826</div>

<div class="sidenote">1827</div>

<p>On the 3rd of March, 1826, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>
commenced their march for Portpatrick, embarked
there for Ireland, and took up their quarters
at Dundalk, Belturbet, and Longford, the
squadron from which latter place afterwards
marched to Belfast. On the 23rd of September,
the regiment assembled at Dundalk, and was
there inspected by Major-General Sir Colquhoun
Grant, the detached squadrons immediately returning
to their former quarters, and the whole
marching into Dublin, in June 1827, and occupying
Portobello barracks. The regiment remained
at Dublin nine months, and then marched
into Connaught, receiving the highest praise from
Lieutenant-General Sir George Murray. It was
then quartered as follows: one troop and head-quarters
at Ballinrobe, two troops at Athlone, two
troops at Gort, and one at Loughrea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828</div>

<div class="sidenote">1829</div>

<p>The five detached troops received orders on
the 30th of June to proceed to Ennis, to assist in
preserving the peace during the Clare election.
Two troops were quartered in a ruined distillery,
two in the yards of the infirmary, and one at
Clare Castle, where Major-General Sir Charles
Doyle, who had arrived from Limerick, established
his head-quarters. The troops remained at Ennis
ten days, and then returned to their former stations,
the regiment being stationed in Connaught
for fifteen months, and receiving on three several
occasions the highest character from Major-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Taylor, and Major-General Sir Thomas Arbuthnot,
K.C.B., the inspecting general officers; the
latter of whom was pleased to express 'his regret
at losing from his district a regiment which had
done itself such credit by its excellent conduct,
while under his command.' This order is dated
30th April, 1829; and in the beginning of the next
month, the regiment embarked at Dublin for England,
being ordered to proceed to Exeter; but on
landing at Liverpool, it was detained in the north,
in consequence of some disturbances there, and
ordered to march on the evening of debarkation
to Prescot, one squadron being directed upon Manchester,
and troops to Bury, Bolton, Blackburn,
and Haslingden. On the 15th of June, the head-quarters
moved to Sheffield, the troops from
Bolton occupying Rochdale; and on the 5th of
July, in consequence of riots in the town of
Barnsley, a troop was sent thither, and remained
there till the following spring.</p>

<p>In September General Viscount Combermere
was removed to the first life guards; and the
colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> was conferred on Lieut.-General
Lord George Thomas Beresford, G.C.H.</p>

<p>In the course of this year a squadron was detached
to Doncaster, in consequence of riots at
the races there; and the regiment was inspected
by Major-General Sir H. Vivian, when Colonel
Lord Robert Manners received the directions
of the Major-General to express his approbation of
the state of the regiment, and in addition to the
flattering terms in which the General expressed
his opinion of the officers and men on the parade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
he directed the commanding officer to issue an
order, entirely approving of all he had seen,
which order he desired might not only be entered
in the regimental order book, but likewise inserted
in the regimental records.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830</div>

<p>On the 6th of April, 1830, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>
marched into York, detaching one troop to Newcastle-on-Tyne:
and on the 21st of May, they
were reviewed by Major-General Sir H. Bouverie,
commanding the northern district.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> On the 25th
of November, the regiment left York <i lang="fr">en route</i>  to
Nottingham, being ordered there to replace troops
employed in quelling disturbances in the south of
England. On the 6th of December, one troop
was detached to Loughborough, in consequence
of riots there, and returned on the 17th, receiving
a vote of thanks from the magistrates of Leicestershire
for their readiness and promptitude. On
the 22nd, the regiment was ordered to complete
its establishment to the full numbers, and accordingly
detached parties to Loughborough and
Derby; and on the 29th, the first division, immediately
followed by the others, left Nottingham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>and returned to York. At York an increase in
the number of horses took place, the number per
troop being fixed at forty-five.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>In consequence of a sudden order received on
the night of the 2nd of March, 1831, for the
regiment to march on the following morning,
one squadron moved to Leeds, and the second to
Burnley; but on the 4th of April, the latter
squadron returned to Leeds to succeed the first,
which had marched to Newcastle. On the 25th
of the same month, a troop marched to Chester-le-Street,
near Durham; and on the 5th and 6th
of May, the remaining part of the regiment left
Leeds for Newcastle. In this quarter the regiment
was employed in the suppression of riots among
the colliers, and was inspected by Major-General
Dalbiac.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1832</div>

<p>On the 23rd of September, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>
marched in three divisions to Edinburgh, where
they remained for eight months; and in April,
1832, proceeded to Glasgow and Hamilton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1833</div>

<div class="sidenote">1834</div>

<div class="sidenote">1835</div>

<p>Returning to England in the spring of 1833, the
regiment was stationed at Ipswich and Norwich;
in the summer of 1834 it was removed to Hounslow
and took the King's duty; and in the summer
of 1835 it embarked for Ireland, and occupied
quarters at Cork, Ballincollig, and Limerick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1836</div>

<div class="sidenote">1837</div>

<p>In June, 1836, the <span class="smcap">King's Own</span> were stationed
at Cahir and Clonmel; and returning to England
in the spring of 1837, they proceeded to Canterbury.
On the 19th May, 1837, Colonel Joseph
Thackwell, late of the 15th Hussars, exchanged
from the half-pay with Lieutenant Colonel Stisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiment, having been selected to proceed
to the East Indies, embarked in July, 1837, for
Bengal, and landed at Calcutta on the 13th of
November following, under the command of
Colonel Thackwell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838</div>

<p>The regiment was encamped in January, 1838,
at Calcutta; in February at Burkee; in March
at Kusseah; in April at Cawnpore, where it continued
until the end of the year.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1839</div>

<p>In February, 1839, the regiment was encamped
at Chibbermold; in March at Meerut, at which
station it remained until December, when it returned
to Cawnpore.</p>

<p>The decease of Lieutenant-General Lord George
Thomas Beresford, G.C.H., having taken place on
the 26th October, 1839, Her Majesty was pleased
to confer the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Third, or King's
Own Light Dragoons</span>, on Lieutenant General
Lord Charles Somerset Manners, K.C.B., on the
8th November, 1839: Lord Charles Manners had
commanded the regiment as Lieutenant-Colonel
from 1812 to 1825, when he was promoted to
the rank of Major-General.</p>

<p>On the 13th December, 1839, Lieut.-Colonel
Michael White was promoted by purchase in
succession to Lieut.-Colonel G. G. Tuite.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1840</div>

<div class="sidenote">1842</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Cawnpore until
October, 1840, when it proceeded to Kurnaul. It
marched from thence on 28th January, 1842, <i lang="fr">en
route</i>  for Ferozepore, having been selected to
form part of the force which had been ordered to
proceed under Major-General Pollock to relieve
the troops under Colonel Sir Robert Sale, who
had gallantly defended Jellalabad; and also for
the purpose of inflicting retribution upon the
Affghans, whose treachery had caused the loss of
so many brave officers and soldiers.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Third Light Dragoons</span> continued their
advance on Peshawur, and a squadron of the
regiment, under Lieutenant Unett, protected the
column of attack under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Taylor, of Her Majesty's Ninth
Regiment of Foot, which captured the heights on
the right entrance to the <em>Khyber Pass</em>, on the
5th April, 1842. Major-General Pollock, in his
despatch announcing the successful advance of
the troops into the Khyber Pass, states: 'there
were some of the enemy's horse in the vicinity
of Ali Musjid, but I regret they did not wait for
Brigadier White (Lieutenant-Colonel of the
<span class="smcap">King's Own</span>) and his brigade to make an
example of them.'</p>

<p>The regiment arrived at Jellalabad in April,
1842, where it remained until the 14th August
following, when it proceeded to Futteabad, detaching
one squadron to Mammoo Khail on the
23rd of that month. The <span class="smcap">Third Light Dragoons</span>
left Futteabad on the 2nd September, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
on arriving at <em>Jugdulluck</em>, the summits of the hills,
which command the road through the pass, were
perceived to be occupied by a considerable number
of the enemy, who were assembled in bodies under
different chieftains, each having a distinguishing
standard; their position was one of singular
strength and difficulty of approach. The heights
occupied by the Ghilzies formed an amphitheatre,
inclining towards the left of the road, on
which the troops were halted, while the guns
opened; and the enemy were thus enabled, on this
point, to fire into the column, a deep ravine preventing
the troops coming in contact with them.</p>

<p>The British troops, however, on attacking one
of their hill-forts, gave an animated and enthusiastic
cheer, which so dismayed the enemy, that
they fled down the heights without waiting the
collision, and were thus enabled to escape chastisement
by the nature of the ground, which was
so well calculated to favour their retreat. At
this moment, Major Lockwood with the <span class="smcap">Third,
King's Own Light Dragoons</span>, galloped up, and
nearly succeeded in overtaking the enemy's cavalry,
who effected their safety by flight.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The loss of the regiment at the storming of the
heights of <em>Jugdulluck</em> on the 8th of September,
1842, was limited to two men wounded.</p>

<p>Major-General Pollock, in his despatch, speaks
of the conduct of the troops employed in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>'It gratifies me to be enabled to state, that we
have thus signally defeated, with one division of
the troops, the most powerful tribes, and the
most inveterate of our enemies, the original and
principal actors in those disturbances which
entailed such disasters on our troops last winter.'</p>

<p>The regiment was also engaged with the enemy
in the <em>Tezeen</em> valley, which is completely encircled
by lofty hills; the pass of Tezeen affords great
advantages to an enemy occupying the heights,
and Mahomed Akbar-Khan neglected nothing to
render its natural difficulties as formidable as
possible; accordingly on the morning of the 13th
September, the Affghans appeared in great force
on every height which had not been occupied by
the British army. Two squadrons of the <span class="smcap">Third
Light Dragoons</span>, a party of the first light cavalry,
and of the third irregular cavalry, with two guns,
were left to guard the mouth of the Tezeen pass.
The enemy's horse appeared in the valley with
the intention of falling upon the baggage; but
the Light Dragoons and native cavalry made a
most brilliant charge, and completely routed the
whole body of the enemy's force, cutting down
a great number of them. The fight continued
during the greater part of the day, the Affghans
appearing resolved to prevent our ascending the
<em>Huft Kotul</em>; one spirit, however, pervaded all,
and the determination to conquer overcame the
obstinate resistance of the foe, who were at length
forced from their numerous and strong positions,
and the British troops mounted the <em>Huft Kotul</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
giving three cheers on reaching the summit.
Here Lieutenant Cunningham, with a party of
sappers, pressed the enemy so hard, that they
left in their precipitation a twenty-four pounder
howitzer and limber, carrying off the draught
bullocks. Information being received that another
gun had been seen, a squadron of cavalry under
Captain Tritton, of the <span class="smcap">Third Light Dragoons</span>,
and two horse artillery guns, under Major Delafosse,
were detached in pursuit; the gun (a twelve-pounder
howitzer) and bullocks sufficient for the
two guns, were soon captured. The Light Dragoons
again got among the enemy, and succeeded
in destroying many of them. Captain Broadfoot,
with the sappers, advanced, and with the dragoons
happened to fall in with another party of Affghans,
of whom upwards of twenty were killed. It was
ascertained, that the enemy numbered sixteen
thousand, a considerable portion being cavalry;
and that Mahomed Akbar-Khan, with several
other powerful chiefs, was present<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

<p>The British thus gained a complete victory,
and the enemy must have suffered severely,
several hundreds of them having been killed, and
their guns, and three standards, captured from
them. A detachment of the <span class="smcap">Third Light Dragoons</span>
formed part of the rear-guard of the army
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Richmond,
of the 33rd Native Infantry, and it being resolved
to anticipate the evident intention of the Affghans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
by attacking them in the valley of Tezeen, on the
13th September, the guns were moved forward
within range of the enemy, supported by the
front squadron of the <span class="smcap">Third Light Dragoons</span>
under Captain Unett, with other corps, in order
to charge the foe if the ground proved favourable,
and an opportunity offered; this soon occurred,
the guns having made good impression, and the
other squadron of cavalry, under Major Lockwood,
was hurried forward as a support, thus ensuring
the success achieved by the spirited and gallant
charge of their comrades in front, which completely
dispersed the enemy, who left about fifty
men on the field.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Major-General Pollock, in his despatch of the
action at <em>Tezeen</em>, expresses his satisfaction with
the exertions of Lt.-Colonel White of the <span class="smcap">Third
Light Dragoons</span>, commanding the cavalry brigade,
and also of Major Lockwood, who commanded
the regiment. The <span class="smcap">Third Light Dragoons</span>
sustained but trifling loss in the <em>Tezeen</em>
valley, and on the Huft Kotul, on the 12th and
13th September, having only one serjeant and
four rank and file wounded; two horses killed,
and eleven wounded.</p>

<p>After these successes, the army moved on without
opposition, and arrived at <span class="smcap">Cabool</span> on the 15th
September, where they encamped on the race
course. The <span class="smcap">Third Light Dragoons</span>, under
Major Lockwood, proceeded with other corps to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
plant the British colours in the <em>Bala Hissar</em>, on
the spot most conspicuous from the city. On the
colours being hoisted, the band of Her Majesty's
Ninth Regiment of Foot struck up 'God save the
Queen,' and a royal salute was fired from the guns
of the horse artillery, the whole of the troops
present giving three cheers. The colours in the
Bala Hissar were hoisted daily as long as the army
remained at Cabool.</p>

<p>The head-quarters and two squadrons of the
regiment, under Major Lockwood, formed part
of the force which was detached under Major-General
McCaskill (Lieutenant-Colonel of the
Ninth Foot), for the purpose of dispersing the
enemy collected in the vicinity of <em>Charekar</em>, and
took part in the operations against the strong
and populous town of <em>Istalif</em>, which was considered
by the Affghans as totally inaccessible, but which
was captured on the 29th September 1842; the
numerous levies collected for its defence were
totally defeated, and property of every description
(much of it plundered from the army in 1841)
was recovered; two brass field-pieces were captured,
one of which was seized with such promptitude,
that its captor, Lieutenant Elmhirst, of Her
Majesty's Ninth Foot, turned its fire upon the
fugitives with some effect<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the gratifying results of these successes
was the release of several ladies and officers who
had been detained prisoners by Akbar-Khan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>The regiment, having been present during the
whole of the operations west of the Indus, leading
to the occupation of Cabool, has received the
Royal permission to bear on its appointments the
word '<em>Cabool 1842</em>.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">1843</div>

<div class="sidenote">1844</div>

<p>The regiment left Cabool on the 12th October,
1842, and arrived at Ferozepore on the 18th
December, from whence it marched to Kurnaul,
where it arrived on the 27th January 1843; it
remained at Kurnaul until November, when it
marched for Umballa, and continued at that station
during the year 1844, and until the end of the
following year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1845</div>

<p>On the 11th December, 1845, the regiment, consisting
of 518 men, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Michael White, marched from cantonments
at Umballa, and formed a part of the leading
division of the <em>Army of the Sutlej</em>, hastily assembled,
under the personal command of General
Sir Hugh Gough, G.C.B., Commander-in-Chief
in India, for the purpose of repelling an invasion
by the <em>Sikhs</em>.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>On arriving at the village of <em>Moodkee</em>, a distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of one hundred and fifty miles, on the 18th
December, the army had just taken up its encampments,
when intelligence was received, that
the enemy's forces, consisting of twenty thousand
cavalry, and about the same number of infantry
and artillery, were close at hand, and intended to
surprise the British camps. The cavalry were immediately
turned out, and advanced to cover the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>formation of the infantry, and the distinguished
part which the <em>Third, or King's Own Regiment of
Light Dragoons</em>, took in the sanguinary and
memorable battle of the evening of that day may
be best judged from the words of His Excellency
the Commander-in-Chief in his despatch of the
19th December 1845:&mdash;'I directed the cavalry,
under Brigadiers White and Gough (of the
<span class="smcap">King's Own</span>), to make a flank movement on
the enemy's left, with a view of threatening and
turning that flank, if possible.</p>

<p>'With praiseworthy gallantry, the <span class="smcap">Third
Light Dragoons</span>, and the second brigade of
cavalry, consisting of the body-guard and Fifth
Light cavalry, with a portion of the Fourth
Lancers, turned the left of the Sikh army, and
sweeping along the whole rear of its infantry and
guns, silenced for a time the latter, and put their
numerous cavalry to flight.'</p>

<p>In this action the regiment suffered severely,
owing to the nature of the ground, and the immense
body of cavalry opposed to it. The loss,
out of four hundred and ninety-four men, on this
occasion, was as follows:&mdash;killed, 3 officers, 58
men; 5 officers' chargers, and 100 troop horses;
wounded, 3 officers, 34 men; 2 officers' chargers,
and 21 troop horses.</p>

<p>Brevet Major W. R. Herries, Captain G. Newton,
and Cornet E. Worley, were killed.</p>

<p>Lieutenant S. Fisher (Acting Major of Brigade),
E. G. Swinton, and E. B. Cureton, were severely
wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 21st December, the army again advanced;
the Third Light Dragoons had about
four hundred men; and came up with the enemy,
said to consist of 70,000 men, who were strongly
posted in and around the village of "<span class="smcap">Ferozeshah</span>"
their camp intrenched, and defended by a numerous
and powerful artillery.</p>

<p>At about four o'clock in the afternoon the
action became general. The <em>Third Light Dragoons</em>
were ordered to attack the enemy's position at a
point defended by some of the heaviest batteries,
most of the guns being of battering calibre: as
the regiment advanced, it was assailed with round
shot and shell from several batteries. On arriving
within about two hundred and fifty yards
of the guns, the regiment moved on at top speed,
under a most destructive fire of grape and musketry,
whilst their infantry held the trenches at
the point of the bayonet. Nothing dismayed,
but determined on victory, the regiment pressed
forward, and never for a moment was checked in its
career until it finally entered the enemy's camp, and
captured the whole of the batteries opposed to it;
many of the Sikh artillerymen remaining to be cut
down at their guns. Night having fallen, while
the conflict was everywhere raging, and several
mines having been sprung, together with the exploding
of their field magazines, by which several
men and horses were destroyed, the regiment was
withdrawn a short distance from the burning camp,
where it bivouacked for the night.</p>

<p>The enemy having held a portion of his position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and being strongly reinforced in the night, the
battle was renewed the next morning, and the
<em>Third Light Dragoons</em> at daybreak joined the
remainder of the cavalry, and participated in the
action of the 22nd of December, when about
three o'clock, <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, the <em>Third Light Dragoons</em>
were again ordered to charge the enemy, which he
did not wait to receive, and he was finally driven
from the field, and the army bivouacked on the
ground they had won. The men and horses of
the <em>Third Light Dragoons</em> were upwards of forty
hours without food or water, nearly the whole of
the time exposed to, and in conflict with, a powerful
enemy; the days were hot and the nights
intensely cold.</p>

<p>In this great battle the regiment lost as follows:&mdash;killed,
2 officers and 53 men; wounded,
7 officers and 86 men; total, 9 officers and 139
men: killed, 9 officers' chargers and 98 troop
horses: wounded, 60 troop horses; total killed and
wounded, 9 officers' chargers and 158 troop horses.</p>

<p>The officers killed, were Captain J. E. Codd and
Cornet H. Ellis; wounded, Colonel M. White,
slightly: Major C. W. M. Balders, slightly:
Lieutenants, H. C. Morgan, severely; J. G. A.
Beeston, slightly: Cornets, W. H. Orme, severely;
J. D. White and J. Rathwell, slightly.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief, in his despatch of
the 22nd December, 1845, observes as follows:
'Although I brought up Major-General Sir Harry
Smith's division, and he captured and long retained
another point of the position, and Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Majesty's Third Light Dragoons charged and
took some of the most formidable batteries, yet
the enemy remained in possession of a considerable
portion of the great quadrangle, whilst
our troops, intermingled with theirs, kept possession
of the remainder, and finally bivouacked
upon it, exhausted by their gallant efforts, greatly
reduced in numbers, and suffering extremely
from thirst, yet animated by an indomitable
spirit. In this state of things, the long night
wore away!'</p>

<p>The Right Honourable the Governor-General,
(Lord Hardinge), who personally witnessed the
prowess of the regiment on the battle-field, makes
honorable mention thereof in his Orders, dated
30th December, 1845.</p>

<p>'The Governor-General offers his thanks more
especially to Her Majesty's Third Light Dragoons,
who, on all these occasions, sought opportunities
of useful conflict with the enemy,
and fought with that superiority over their opponents
which skill and discipline impart to brave
and determined men.'</p>

<p>The regiment was detached from the army at
Sultan-Khan-Wallah, and sent to <em>Ferozepore</em>,
where it arrived on the 31st December 1845.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1846</div>

<p>It remained at Ferozepore until the 18th January,
1846, and again proceeded to, and joined,
the head quarters of the army at Jelliwallah, on
the 20th of January.</p>

<p>The glorious action at <em>Aliwal</em> took place on the
28th of January, 'when the enemy's camp was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
carried by storm; the whole of his cannon and
munitions of war were captured, and his army
driven headlong across the Sutlej; even on the
right bank of which he found no refuge from
the fire of our artillery.'</p>

<p>The Third Light Dragoons were assembled on
parade on the morning of the 29th of January to
celebrate the victory of <em>Aliwal</em>, when the Right
Honourable the Governor-General, in the presence
of the whole army, was pleased to make
use of the following words, most gratifying to
the feelings of every soldier:&mdash;'Colonel White,
your regiment is an honour to the British army;
and I wish you to make known these my sentiments,
as head of this Government, to your
officers and men.'</p>

<p>On the 10th of February, 1846, the regiment
had the proud satisfaction of sharing and taking
a conspicuous part in that glorious and mighty
combat, <em>the Battle of Sobraon</em>, when the Sikhs
were driven from their stronghold, and precipitated
in masses into the Sutlej, and those proud
invaders were expelled the soil of British India.</p>

<p>The Right Honourable the Governor-General,
in his Order of Thanks to the Army, was pleased
to pass the following high encomium on the conduct
of the regiment in this fight:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Her Majesty's Third Light Dragoons, as usual,
were in the foremost ranks, and distinguished
themselves under their commanding officer,
Lieut.-Colonel White.'</p>

<p>His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
his despatch, dated 13th February, 1846, thus
expresses his unqualified approbation of the conduct
of the regiment on this occasion:&mdash;'The
Sikhs, even when at particular points their intrenchments
were mastered by the bayonet, strove
to regain them by the fiercest conflict sword in
hand; nor was it until the cavalry of the left,
under the command of Major-General Sir Joseph Thackwell,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
had moved forward and ridden
through the openings in the intrenchments
made by our Sappers, in single files, and reformed
as they passed them, and the Third
Light Dragoons, whom no obstacle usually held
formidable by horse, appears to check, had on
this day, <em>as at Ferozeshah</em>, galloped over, and
cut down the obstinate defenders of batteries
and field-works, and until the full weight of
three divisions of infantry with every field artillery
gun which could be sent to their aid, had
been cast into the scale, that victory finally declared
for the British.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>'The fire of the Sikhs first slackened, and
then nearly ceased; and the victors then pressing
them on every side, precipitated them in masses
over their bridge, and into the Sutlej, which a
sudden rise of seven inches had rendered hardly
fordable. In their efforts to reach the right
bank through the deepened water, they suffered
from our horse-artillery a terrible carnage:
hundreds fell under this cannonade; hundreds
upon hundreds were drowned in attempting the
perilous passage. Their awful slaughter, confusion,
and dismay, were such as would have
excited compassion in the hearts of their generous
conquerors, if the Khalsa troops had not, in the
earlier part of the action, sullied their gallantry
by slaughtering and barbarously mangling every
wounded soldier, whom, in the vicissitudes of
attack, the fortune of war left at their mercy.</p>

<p>'I must pause in this narrative to notice, especially,
the determined hardihood and bravery
with which our two battalions of Ghoorkhas,
the Sirmoor and Nusseeree, met the Sikhs,
wherever they were opposed to them: soldiers,
of small stature but indomitable spirit, they
vied in ardent courage in the charge with the
grenadiers of our own nation; and armed with
the short weapon of their mountains, were a
terror to the Sikhs throughout this great
combat.</p>

<p>'Sixty-seven pieces of cannon, upwards of two
hundred camel-swivels (zumbooruks), numerous
standards, and vast munitions of war, cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>tured
by our troops, are the pledges and
trophies of our victory.</p>

<p>'The battle was over by eleven in the morning;
and in the forenoon I caused our engineers
to burn a part, and to sink a part, of the vaunted
bridge of the Khalsa army, across which they
had boastfully come once more to defy us, and to
threaten India with ruin and devastation.</p>

<p>'The consequences of this great action have
yet to be fully developed. It has at least, in
God's providence, once more expelled the Sikhs
from our territory, and planted our standards
on the soil of the Punjaub. After occupying
their entrenched position for nearly a month, the
Khalsa army had perhaps mistaken the <em>caution</em>,
which had induced us to wait for the necessary
materiel, for <em>timidity</em>: but they must now deeply
feel, that the blow, which has fallen on them
from the British arm, has only been the heavier
for being long delayed.'</p>

<p>The following are the losses sustained by the
Third Light Dragoons in the action of <em>Sobraon</em>:
killed, 5 men, 1 troop horse; wounded, 4 officers
and 22 men, 2 officers' chargers and 13 troop
horses.</p>

<p>The officers wounded were, Lieutenant-Colonel
J. B. Gough (Acting Quarter-Master General),
very severely; Lieutenant J. B. Hawkes, slightly;
Cornet Kauntze, severely; and Quarter-Master
A. Crabtree, slightly.</p>

<p>The Third Light Dragoons crossed the Sutlej
on the 13th February, 1846, and marched on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
<em>Lahore</em>, where the British army arrived on the
20th, and encamped on that soil held sacred by
the Khalsa troops, the 'Plains of Myan Meer,'
where it remained until the 24th March. The
object for which the army was assembled having
been attained, the Third Light Dragoons returned
to their former quarters at Umballa on the 7th
April, having, in less than four months, marched
upwards of six hundred miles, and taken a conspicuous
part in <em>three</em> of the greatest actions
recorded in the annals of British India.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of February, 1846, the Right
Honourable the Governor-General made the following
announcement in General Orders:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The British Army has this day occupied the
gateway of the <em>Citadel of Lahore</em>, the Badshahee
Mosque, and the Huzzooree Bagh.</p>

<p>'The <em>Army of the Sutlej</em> has now brought its
operations in the field to a close, by the dispersion
of the Sikh army, and the military occupation
of <em>Lahore</em>, preceded by a series of the most
triumphant successes ever recorded in the military
history of India.</p>

<p>'The British government, trusting to the faith
of treaties, and to the long subsisting friendship
between the two states, had limited military
preparations to the defence of its own frontier.
Compelled suddenly to assume the offensive,
by the unprovoked invasion of its territories,
the British Army, under the command of its
distinguished leader, has, in sixty days, defeated
the Sikh forces in <em>four general actions</em>; has cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>tured
<em>two hundred and twenty pieces</em> of field artillery;
and is now at the <em>Capital</em> dictating to the
<em>Lahore Durbar</em> the terms of a treaty, the conditions
of which will tend to secure the British
Provinces from the repetition of a similar outrage.'</p>

<p>On the 4th March, 1846, the Governor-General
made the following further announcement:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Early on the morning of the 22nd February,
a brigade of British troops took formal possession
of the <em>Citadel of Lahore</em>, the Badshahee Musjed,
and the Huzzooree Bagh.</p>

<p>'I considered the occupation of Lahore, and the
close of active operations in the field, a proper
opportunity for marking, by substantial reward,
the gratitude of the British Government to its
faithful and brave army, which had fought so
gloriously, and so successfully; and I was glad
at being able thus to bring into prominent contrast,
the just reward of discipline and obedience,
with the certain penalty of insubordination and
violence, as exemplified in the fate of the two
armies, which had been so long the objects of
mutual observation; the one, victorious in the
field, and honoured and bountifully rewarded
by its Government; the other, in spite of its
exceeding numbers and advantageous positions,
vanquished in every battle, abandoned by a
government it had coerced, and, with its shattered
remains, left, but for the intercession of
its conquerors, to disperse with no provision of
any kind, and to seek a precarious subsistence by
rapine and crime.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The King's Own Regiment of Light Dragoons</span>,
from the period of its formation in 1685,
to the present time, has performed upwards of
one hundred and sixty years' faithful and meritorious
service in the reign of nine successive
monarchs. It was employed in the several wars
on the continent of Europe during the reigns of
King William III.,&mdash;of Queen Anne,&mdash;and of
King George II. It was again employed in Portugal,
Spain, and France, from 1811 to 1818. It
has been since engaged in most arduous duties
in <em>Affghanistan</em>, and on the banks of the <em>Sutlej</em>,
where it has acquired additional honours by its
bravery; it continues to be employed in guarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the possessions of the British Crown in the distant
clime of India.</p>

<p>Whether confronting a foreign enemy in the
field, or performing duties of a painful character
at home, its conduct has, on all occasions, been
such as to procure the acknowledgments of the
Civil Authorities by whom its assistance was
required;&mdash;the commendations of the General
Officers under whose immediate command it has
served;&mdash;the thanks of Parliament; and the approbation
of its Sovereign.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>The compiler of the Records of the Army feels it his duty
to acknowledge, that his labours have been greatly assisted by a
memoir of the services of the Third, or the King's Own, Light
Dragoons, which was printed, in 1833, by Lieutenant Colonel
Charles Stisted, then lieutenant-colonel of the regiment. King
William IV. expressed himself much satisfied with the manner
in which the Colonel had executed a task, to which His
Majesty attached great importance, and gave him credit for
the zeal and industry with which he had undertaken and prosecuted
it; a notification to the above effect was made to
Lieutenant-Colonel Stisted by Lieutenant-General Sir Herbert
Taylor, G.C.H. Lieutenant Colonel Stisted entered the
Army in May, 1794, as an ensign in the 39th Regiment.&mdash;He
was appointed to a lieutenancy in the 13th Light Dragoons
in January, 1803, and was promoted to be captain of a troop
in February, 1804: he exchanged to the Third Light Dragoons
on the 7th of February, 1811; and was promoted to a majority
on the 14th of October, 1819, and to the Lieutenant-Colonelcy
of the Regiment on the 22nd of July, 1830: he
continued in command of the Regiment until the 19th of
May, 1837, when he exchanged to the half-pay: he was reappointed
to the full pay in September, 1841, and retired
from the service by the sale of his commission; he died at
Torquay on the 24th of July, 1842.</p></blockquote>

behind the hedges. After a few volleys the dragoons were ordered
to retire a few paces, when the highlanders, mistaking this for a
flight, rushed forward with sword and pistol; but were well
received by the dragoons, who had drawn their swords. Now the
shouts began, the clashing of swords is heard, the pistols are fired,
and the event seems doubtful. Some of the rebel's swords broke
upon the steel caps of the dragoons, whereupon they draw their
daggers and fight with great obstinacy.
</p>
<p>
'Thus they continued for about an hour, when the rebels, observing
the resolution of the dragoons, retired across the ditch with precipitation,
and carried consternation to Penrith. Such was the
skirmish at Clifton, in which twelve of the dragoons were slain and
twenty-four wounded. On the side of the rebels were slain twenty,
and seventy taken prisoners.'&mdash;<cite>History of the Rebellion.</cite></p></div>

<p class="right">'Boulogne, July 19th, 1814.</p>
<p>
'Major-General Ponsonby takes this opportunity of expressing to
the brigade the high sense he entertains of their uniformly excellent
conduct, both in quarters and in the field. It is a circumstance
as gratifying to him, as it is creditable to themselves, that,
during the whole period of their service, they have, in no one
instance, collectively or individually, incurred animadversion in
general orders, and that no individual of the brigade has been
brought to a general court-martial. With equal truth the major-general
can assert, that upon every occasion which has presented
itself of acting against the enemy, either regimentally, or in brigade,
they have nobly sustained the superiority of the British cavalry, and
fully justified the high opinion repeatedly expressed of them by
His Grace the Duke of Wellington. The three regiments<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> will
ever have to congratulate themselves on its having fallen to their lot
to be in the brigade employed on the 22nd of July, 1812 (battle
of Salamanca), in that glorious and effectual charge which contributed
in so eminent a degree to decide the fate of the day, and
to secure the signal and complete defeat of the French army.'

His Royal Highness the Prince Regent for permission for the three

<p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> In narrating the services of the regiments which composed the
<em>Army of the Sutlej</em> in the years 1845 and 1846, it may be desirable
that a brief account be given of the country of the Punjaub, particularly
of the <span class="smcap">Sikhs</span>, the most powerful of the population. The
important results of the sanguinary and eventful conflicts in the
Punjaub in 1846, following so rapidly on each other, excited the
warmest interest throughout a great part of the world; and the
heroic deeds of the several regiments employed, added another page
to the records of the glorious achievements of the British Army.
</p>
<p>
The Punjaub, (Punj, five; aub, water,) deriving its name from
the five rivers which intersect it, is an extensive country to the northwest
of India. The chief of these rivers are the Indus and the Sutlej,
by which and by the lofty Himalayas, the whole of this fine territory
is bounded. At the period of the invasion of India by Alexander
the Great, the Punjaub is stated to have been a wealthy and populous
country, governed by numerous princes, whose subjects were characterised
as brave and warlike. The Sikhs, originally a religious
sect, were founded by Nanac, or Nanaïc, Shah, about four centuries
ago; but, in after years, in order probably to defend their doctrines,
they were induced by Govind, one of their high priests, to unite the
warrior with the priestly character, thus forming a military as well
as religious association, not dissimilar to the Templar Knights of the
times of the Crusades. They, however, for a time almost disappeared;
but profiting by the calamities of the Mogul empire during the last
century, the Sikhs threw off the yoke of Mussulman despotism, their
Sirdars or Chieftains spreading themselves over the country, ruling
by might rather than right, and each acting independently of the
other, until the death of Maha Singh in 1792. His son and successor
Runjeet Singh contrived, however, to make several of the Sirdars
acknowledge him as their leader, and by skilful management, in the
course of a short period, obtained possession of <em>Lahore</em>, the principal
city of the <em>Punjaub</em>, and eventually of Cashmere, Mooltan, and
Peshawur. In the end all the chiefs submitted to him; thus bringing
the whole country, from the Indus to the Sutlej, under his rule. He
was greatly aided in his views of aggrandisement by the assistance of
a few Italian and French officers, who trained his army upon the
European model, and by their instructions it attained a high degree
of discipline, proving one of the strongest enemies the British had
ever contended with in India. Since the death of Runjeet in 1839,
anarchy and confusion have prevailed; hatred of the English, which
his influence checked, manifested itself, finally inducing the Sikh
forces to invade the British territories, by crossing the Sutlej in
great numbers in December, 1845, actuated as much by the hope of
plunder, as by the desire of conquest.</p></div>

<h2>SUCCESSION OF COLONELS<br />

OF THE<br />

THIRD, <span class="smcap">OR</span> THE KING'S OWN REGIMENT<br />

OF<br />

LIGHT DRAGOONS.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Charles, Duke</span> of <span class="smcap">Somerset</span>, K.G.<br />

<em>Appointed 2nd August, 1685.</em></h3>

<p>This nobleman succeeded to the title of <span class="smcap">Duke</span> of <span class="smcap">Somerset</span>
on the decease of his brother, who was murdered at Lerice, in
Italy, on the 20th of April, 1678. He was elected a Knight
of the Garter in April, 1684, and was one of the privy councillors
who signed the proclamation of the accession of King
James II., on the 6th of February following. Being Lord-Lieutenant
of Somersetshire at the time of the rebellion of
the Duke of Monmouth, he called out the militia of the
county, and was rewarded for his fidelity to the Crown with
the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Queen Consort's</span> Regiment of Dragoons,
and the appointment of lord of the bed-chamber to His
Majesty; but was removed from his regiment and court appointment
for refusing to attend a nuncio from Pope Innocent
XI. into the King's presence. At the Revolution in 1688,
his grace joined the Prince of Orange, afterwards William III.,
during part of whose reign he presided at the council,
and was one of the lords of the regency when His Majesty
made his last visit to the Continent. The Duke of Somerset
was also a privy councillor, and master of the horse during part
of the reign of Queen Anne; and, after Her Majesty's demise,
he was one of the guardians of the realm until the arrival of
George I. from Hanover. He died on the 2nd of Dec., 1748,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral: a fine marble monument
of his grace was afterwards placed in the senate-house
of the University of Cambridge.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Alexander Cannon.</span><br />

<em>Appointed 2nd August, 1687.</em></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexander Cannon</span> entered the service of the United Provinces
of the Netherlands, and held a commission in one of
the English regiments in Holland, with which he served under
the Prince of Orange (afterwards King William III.), and
was promoted to the colonelcy of the corps. Having arrived
in England with his regiment in the summer of 1685, to assist
in suppressing the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth, he
quitted the Dutch service, and was appointed, by King
James II., Lieutenant-Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> Dragoons.
He was a stanch adherent to the Court, and was rewarded
with the colonelcy of the regiment in 1687; but refusing to
take the oath to the Prince of Orange, at the Revolution in
1688, he was removed from his command.</p>

<p>Colonel Cannon proceeded to Ireland in 1689, where he
was promoted by King James to the rank of brigadier-general;
he was sent with a small body of men to Scotland, to
assist the highlanders in their opposition to the government
of King William III. He was second in command at
the Battle of Killicrankie, and after the fall of Viscount
Dundee, he commanded the Highlanders and Irish. He was
reinforced by another body of troops from Ireland under Brigadier-General
Buchan, and remained in Scotland two years;
but being harassed by the King's forces, and defeated in
several skirmishes, the highlanders tendered their submission
to King William, and their commanders followed King
James to France.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Richard Leveson.</span><br />

<em>Appointed 31st December, 1688.</em></h3>

<p>In the reign of King Charles II. <span class="smcap">Richard Leveson</span> served
as a volunteer against the Moors at Tangier, in Africa; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
on the breaking out of the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth
in June, 1685, he raised a troop of dragoons in the county of
Middlesex, which troop was eventually incorporated in the
<span class="smcap">Queen's</span> regiment, now <span class="smcap">Third</span>, or <span class="smcap">King's Own</span>. In the
summer of 1687, he was promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy,
and having joined the standard of the Prince of Orange, in
November, 1688, he was advanced, on the 31st of December
following, to the colonelcy of the regiment. He served at
the head of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> Dragoons in Ireland; evinced great
personal bravery at the Battle of the Boyne, and on other
occasions, as detailed in the record of the <span class="smcap">Third</span> Light Dragoons;
and acquired celebrity for his ability, activity, and
gallantry on detached services. After the decease of Brigadier-General
Villiers, King William rewarded the brave <span class="smcap">Leveson</span>
with the command of a corps of cuirassiers, now second dragoon
guards. He served under His Majesty in the Netherlands,
and was promoted to the rank of major-general on the 11th
of January, 1696. His decease occurred on the 3rd of
March, 1699.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Thomas, Lord Fairfax.</span><br />

<em>Appointed 30th January, 1694.</em></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Fairfax</span> having joined the Prince of Orange at the
Revolution in 1688, was appointed lieutenant and lieutenant-colonel
in the third troop of life guards, which gave him the
privilege of taking the court duty of silver stick; he afterwards
exchanged to the second troop (now second regiment)
of life guards, from which he was promoted to the colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> dragoons. He retired in the following year,
and was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general in 1702.
He died in January, 1710.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">William Lloyd.</span><br />

<em>Appointed 21st February, 1695.</em></h3>

<p>This Officer served with distinction under King William
III. in Ireland and the Netherlands, and was promoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
to the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> Dragoons by purchase, in
1695. He served with his regiment in Flanders until the
peace of Ryswick; was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general
in the spring of 1702; and, commanding a brigade of
infantry under the Duke of Ormond, in the expedition to
Spain, was engaged in the storming of the forts of Vigo.
He was subsequently advanced to the rank of major-general;
but obtained permission to dispose of the colonelcy of his
regiment in 1703, to Colonel Carpenter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">George Carpenter.</span><br />

<em>Appointed 31st December, 1703.</em></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">George Carpenter</span> was born in February, 1657, and when
fourteen years of age he was page to the Duke of Montague
in his grace's embassy to France. In 1672, he entered the
army as a private gentleman in the Duke of York's troop of
life guards, which corps was, at that period, as a school where
young gentlemen were qualified for commissions. In 1685
he was appointed troop quarter-master in a newly-raised corps
of cuirassiers, now second dragoon guards; in which regiment
he rose to the rank of cornet in 1687, and afterwards to that
of lieutenant, captain, and lieutenant-colonel. He served
with his regiment in Ireland, and in Flanders and Brabant,
and was promoted to the rank of colonel in the army in 1702.
In the following year he purchased the colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">Queen's</span> Dragoons and was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general
on the 25th of December, 1705. He proceeded to
Spain in 1706, and serving with the allied army, signalized
himself at the unfortunate battle of <em>Almanza</em> in 1707, where
he repeatedly charged at the head of the British cavalry, and,
commanding one of the last squadrons which left the field,
saved the Earl of Galway, many wounded men, and much of
the baggage from falling into the hands of the enemy. He
continued with the army in Spain, acquiring additional honour
by his excellent conduct on all occasions, was promoted to
the rank of major-general in September, 1708, and to that of
lieutenant-general in January, 1710. In the brilliant cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
action on the plains of Almanara, on the 27th of July, 1710,
he highly distinguished himself, and was wounded: his spirited
conduct on this occasion, procured him the thanks of
King Charles III. of Spain, afterwards Emperor of the
Romans, who was with the army. He acquired fresh laurels
at Saragossa and wrote an interesting account of that battle,
which was published at the time. After advancing to Madrid,
the army retreated to Valencia and Catalonia, and Lieutenant-General
Carpenter was with the division under General Stanhope,
which halted at the little walled town of Brihuega, in
the mountains of Castile, and was there surrounded and made
prisoners by the French army. On this occasion he was
wounded by a musket-ball, which, having broken part of his
jaw, lodged itself under the root of his tongue, where it remained
several months before it could be extracted, during
which time his life was in danger, and he suffered great pain.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1715, he was appointed envoy extraordinary
and plenipotentiary to the court of Vienna. During the
rebellion of the Earl of Mar, he commanded a detached corps,
prevented the insurgents obtaining possession of Newcastle-on-Tyne,
and afterwards, joining Major-General Wills, took
a division of the rebel army prisoners, at Preston, in Lancashire.
He was rewarded with the appointment of governor
of Minorca and Port Mahon, and commander of the forces in
Scotland; and in May, 1719, he was advanced to the peerage
of Ireland by the title of <span class="smcap">Baron Carpenter</span> of Killaghy in
the county of Kilkenny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Carpenter</span> was many years a member of Parliament,
first for Whitchurch in Hampshire, and afterwards for
the city of Westminster. He published a highly useful work
entitled 'A Dissertation on the Manœuvres of Cavalry.'
After serving the Crown a period of nearly sixty years, in
the reign of six successive sovereigns, he died, on the 10th of
February, 1732, in the seventy-fifth year of his age, and was
buried at Ouselburg in Hampshire, where a monument was
erected to his memory. He was ancestor of the Earls of
Tyrconnel.</p>

the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the thirty-third foot,
on the 27th of May, 1709, he was promoted to the colonelcy

the chief command of the troops, until the arrival of the Earl
of Stair. At the battle of Dettingen one division of the army
was commanded by this distinguished officer, and he led the
royal horse guards and the King's horse to the charge with
great gallantry. He served in the subsequent campaigns on
the continent with distinction, and with the approbation of
his sovereign, by whom he was advanced to the dignity of a
Knight of the honourable order of the Bath. He died in

stick. In 1746, when King George II. had resolved to disband
the third and fourth troops of life guards, his lordship

</table></div><p>It is worthy of being recorded, that many of the Non-Commissioned
Officers and Men, who were wounded in the different
engagements, concealed the fact, that they might have an
opportunity of sharing in any further Actions in which the
regiment might be engaged. Amongst others, Troop Serjeant-major
<span class="smcap">Walter Eldridge</span>, who received a bayonet wound
through the calf of his leg, in charging over the enemy's
entrenched infantry on the evening of the 21st December,
never reported the circumstance, until from lameness, caused
by inflammation of the leg, the brave fellow could no longer
conceal it. He was immediately conveyed to the Hospital,
where he died in a few days afterwards.</p>

</p>

<p>In forwarding the accompanying return of the casualties which
occurred in the Cavalry Division under my command in the
Action of yesterday, I have the honour to state, for the information
of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, that the
whole of the regiments engaged performed their duty to my
entire satisfaction; but, consequent on the nature of the ground
and the numerous bodies of both Cavalry and Infantry that
were opposed to them, I regret to say the loss has been very
heavy, more particularly in Her Majesty's 3rd Light Dragoons,
who bore the brunt of the Action.</p>

<p>I further beg to bring to the notice of His Excellency, that
Captain Tritton of Her Majesty's 3rd Light Dragoons, my
Assistant Adjutant-General, captured one of the enemy's
Standards with his own hands, which he has delivered over to
me as Commanding the Cavalry Division.</p>

<p>It has also been reported to me by Lieutenant and Adjutant
Sullivan of Her Majesty's 3rd Light Dragoons, that Serjeant
Hinds, and a party of six or seven men of the regiment,
succeeded in capturing two of the enemy's Guns, after cutting
down the whole of the armed party who were with them.
The Guns were marked by order of Lieutenant Sullivan, who
can identify them.</p>

<p>I have in conclusion to add, that the undermentioned
Officers afforded me every assistance, and conducted themselves
throughout the Action to my entire satisfaction, and I beg to
bring them to His Excellency's favourable notice:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>Brigadier Gough, C.B., Her Majesty's 3rd Light Dragoons.</li>

<br />
<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>In compliance with instructions contained in the General
Order by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief of yesterday's
date, I have the honour to report on the operations of
the Cavalry Division under my command during the Actions
of the 21st and 22nd instant, as far as came under my personal
observation, and have the gratification to state, for His
Excellency's information, that every Individual of Her
Majesty's 3rd Light Dragoons, both Officers and Men, performed
their duty with the highest credit to themselves and
their country. This I had an opportunity of witnessing, having
charged at the head of the regiment myself through a battery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
of the enemy's guns which met us with a most galling fire
of grape, and over their infantry entrenched in front of their
camp. This charge was a most gallant and successful one,
as we succeeded in completely driving the enemy from their
guns, though, I regret to say, our loss on this occasion has
been very severe, both in Officers and Men, as will be seen by
the Casualty Return of the Corps.</p>

<p>I beg to bring to his Excellency's favourable notice the
merits of the following Officers who gallantly led the regiment
into action:&mdash;Major Balders, Commanding; Captain
Tritton, Assistant Adjutant-General; Lieutenant Sullivan,
Officiating Major of Brigade; Captain Havelock, and Brigade
Major Wyld of the 4th Lancers; the two latter Officers
were at the time acting under my orders, and charged with the
regiment.</p>

<p>I beg to add, that Major Balders having been wounded in
the charge, the command devolved on Captain Hale, who
brought the regiment out of Action.</p>

<p>During the 22nd, the brigade immediately under my command
was engaged manœuvring during the whole of the day,
sometimes for the protection of our own Artillery, and at others,
with a view of cutting off the enemy's retreat, and capturing
their few remaining guns; in the latter we were not successful,
as, with the exception of about a squadron of Her Majesty's
3rd Light Dragoons and the 4th Regiment of Lancers, the
whole of the Cavalry had been withdrawn off the field. On this
day our loss was comparatively small, having lost a few Non-Commissioned
Officers and Men, and having two Officers'
chargers killed by round shot, one of which was Lieutenant
Sullivan's, my officiating Major of Brigade, being the third
horse shot under him during the Actions of the 18th, 21st, and
22nd December.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
